They just live in a different reality than us. They watch different news than us. Anything right wing is ""unbiased"" and anything left of Fox is propaganda (and they often claim that fox is becoming too far left). They believe what Trump says and they ""fact check"" by making sure one of their far right publications has parroted it. They are surrounded, all day, every day, with completely different information than us.

They also tend to accept when someone they believe says ""I have proof!"" As proof itself,  without ever seeing actual evidence (currently they're doing this with everything Elon says).

The left has a version of this too, which is a story for another day and post, but the fact of the matter is they're not exposing themselves to the same information everyone else gets. So they truly do believe millions of people have died from vaccines.","1_2_5"

Im also baffled by people who need a heart being worried about the possible cardiac problems stemming from being vaccinated.

A third ship stops, and offers to help him, but again, he refuses. Saying God will save me. 

The man eventually drowns, and goes to heaven. When he gets to heaven, he asks God God, I went to church, tithed, do good deeds, why didnt you save me in my time of need?

Ethically I get it, there's bodily autonomy which I generally support.  You can play devil's advocate and say that any transplant recipient could really fuck up after a transplant and get on drugs/alcohol, or not comply with their medication plan and ruin their organ.  It's not like they'll take it back.  However, the principles of ethics dictate that every chance to ensure success must be taken.  You have to prove sobriety - repeatedly.  You have to relocate to the immediate area.  You have to demonstrate financial ability.  You have to have psychiatric counseling.  You have to have a support network and back up plans. 

I would be livid if someone I loved died and gave a gift like this to someone and they pissed it away.

When you say cancer vaccines, think of it as a drug that activates your immune system to kill cancer, CURING you of cancer. 

So far, they all rely on having more traditional forms of treatment as well but the HOPE is that we can eliminate entire toxic branches of traditional cancer treatment. Say just colon surgery, but no need for Folfox chemo treatment later. 

Breast cancer may be just surgery with this and some hormone blockers/targeted therapy. We already removed the heart toxicity of targeted therapy so no more herceptin, next gen drugs are so minimally toxic that the risk of damage to your heart is functionally zero. Add in this and we talking oh, you fatigued, maybe some risk of blood clots if you taking tamoxifen, but everything else bad such as nausea, heart, kidney, even fucking lung damage? GONE...... Note, in clinical trials at moment, results may not be as good as stated here as we learn more but can you FUCKING IMAGINE taking this away from cancer patients?

You find something that the cancer cells have that normal cells don't and you get the immune system mad at it. Because the best target varies from patient to patient, the vaccine are customized. mRNA is great for this because mRNA is way easier to make than proteins. 

Exception: there's a [clinical trial](https://newsroom.clevelandclinic.org/2024/11/08/cleveland-clinic-announces-updated-findings-in-preventive-breast-cancer-vaccine-study) for a vaccine that treats triple-negative breast cancer and also seems to prevent it. The vaccine targets a protein that is expressed in lots of breast cancers. Because the protein is only active during lactation under normal circumstances, it's probably safe to target it in women who don't plan to breastfeed in the future. This strategy may not generalize to any other cancers. 

There are also vaccines that prevent viruses that cause cancer, such as the HPV vaccine.","3_1_5"

For example, the average cancer patient can pay up to $48,000 annually for ""treatment"", assuming five year survival rate they spend $240,000 on treatment. That's big money on the table for them to just piss away by instead offering a $1,000 single vaccine that immediately nullifies it.

We can use a different example, let's look at music/movie streaming services. Companies used to sell you a CD/DVD of the album/movie for you to buy for \~$15 and listen to/watch forever. 

The only potential issue is that this is a one-time purchase, after that initial purchase you never pay them again if you want to listen to that album or watch that movie. Now, they have streaming services that have you paying \~$15 every month to watch/listen to that same media. 

It's the same general logic, why sell something to somebody once when you can alternatively make them pay a subscription for (ideally) the next few years and make exponentially more?

Not a perfect example but the comparison holds water. They effectively want to sell sick people a ""subscription"" to life/healthiness, not a permanent ""ownership"" to it. It's incredibly fucked up and disturbing. Why sell a vaccine for \~$100 when you can charge somebody for ER visits for the next couple months at several THOUSAND dollars to ""treat"" the illness and make so much more money?","6_2_1_1_2_1"

&gt;Look, I am on ""your"" side here about how dumb this is. But we should also read the full article. Hell, I'll even take the full headline

&gt; Bill would ban vaccines in Iowa unless manufacturer waives legal immunity

&gt;Whether you agree or not, there is a legit argument that, 4+ years into thier widespread use, holding them legally accountable is not unreasonable. 

&gt;Don't get me wrong, I will continue to take my mRNA vaccines and look forward to many more (hopefully).

I feel my response is worth reading:

I work in clinical research and there is no way that a pharmaceutical company would open themselves to that amount of risk.

Vaccines are relatively safe. When I say 'relatively', I mean statistically.

Human beings come in all shapes, sizes, and tolerances. What works for most of the population may / will not work for an unfortunate few.

There is a possibility that you can have a previously unknown severe allergic reaction to any number of substances (allergens such as certain foods, synthetic substances, medications) or a combination of them.

Most of the time, after exposure to a potential allergen, if there isn't a reaction within 5 - 15 minutes, it likely means you can tolerate it.

Sometimes, although rarely, there can be a delayed allergic reaction (24 -72 hours later). By this time, it might be impossible to tell how many other substances the person had been exposed to. Also, people can spontaneously develop new allergies at any time.

Sure, one might take an allergen skin test to help determine which substances they are allergic to. However, studies have shown that 50 - 60% of positives are false.

Another way to determine an allergic reaction is to re-exposure. But there isn't an ethical doctor who would take that responsibility by purposely giving medication that is a suspected severe allergen for that patient.

Clinical research studies for these vaccines (and other medications) have already looked for and documented most, if not all, patterns of allergic reactions in people. In short, this is done via the physicians (known as Principal Investigators) with ethical oversight (Institutional Review Boards) and pharmacovigalence teams, along with active monitoring of the study data (Clinical Research Associates) in phases 1, 2, and 3 with each phase undergoing a safety and efficacy review by the FDA before moving onto the next phase. 

Even after approval (permission to market the drug) is granted, it is under the condition that a long-term post-marketing surveillance study must be done, which takes several years or up to decades to complete.

This whole process costs between $1 - 2 billion dollars.

Bringing this back to legal immunity waivers for vaccines: basically, the entire investment made for safety and efficacy will be discarded if this bill becomes law since patients can now sue them for any side effects or deaths, even after they were informed of the risks, based on the results of the completion of the clinical research studies. This, combined with the fact that even after you leave the place where you received the vaccine, it's almost impossible to say with certainty that said vaccine is 100% the cause.

Patient lawsuits from Iowans would not only be a huge additional expense for pharma companies but would also clog up their legal system with cases that would be difficult or impossible to prove.

If this bill becomes law in Iowa, it also might open the floodgates for legal immunity waivers for all other medications since the process of safety and efficacy is done using the same process.","29"

- No cure exists for SSPE.
- Management focuses on supportive care and symptom control using anticonvulsants and antispasmodic drugs.

- Males are more frequently affected than females.
- It typically develops 710 years after the initial measles infection, often in children or adolescents, and is nearly always fatal within 13 years of diagnosis.
- The disease is more common in individuals who contracted measles before the age of 2.

I've said this in a couple of other threads about measles. I had measles as a preschooler before there was a vaccine for it, and I'm left with a suppressed immune system as a parting gift. I've masked for decades, especially if I'm in crowds, because I've had sniffles morph into bronchitis and pneumonia. It takes forever for me to recover from an illness, and papercuts linger far longer than they do for most people. I dare not get a cut on my feet because I can have an open sore for weeks. I have digestive issues, such as bouts of diarrhea that show up for no apparent reason. I will have a sudden intolerance for foods like dairy, and the symptoms of the intolerance will go away as quickly as they came. All because of a disease I caught 60+ years ago.   

Sadly, I think we're going to dig many more children's graves before we wake up and start treating these diseases with the gravitas they deserve. There are a lot of people who refuse to acknowledge a serious problem until it affects them personally.","3_2"

Andrew Wakefield's fraudulent study connecting MMR to autism and bowel disorders was published in 1998. (Wakefield was not originally anti-vaccination, though; he advocated for splitting the MMR vaccine into three separate ones and administering them over the course of a year. Not coincidentally, he had applied for a patent on a single-disease measles vaccine a few months before publishing his paper, and he was paid for the study by a law firm that had plans to sue the MMR vaccine manufacturer.)

The CDC had declared the measles eradicated in 2000 because they'd stopped human to human transmission within the country. But in the wake of the controversy around Wakefield's paper, vaccine hesitancy for the MMR vaccine flared - there was a resultant measles outbreak in 2005, and there were significant communities in New York, North Carolina, and Texas that were experiencing measles outbreaks at the time due to low vaccination rates. Immunization rates dropped even more in the UK, where they were reported as low as 50 percent in some parts of London (down from 92 percent). This vaccine hesistancy started to spread to other vaccines, like Tdap, which ended up contributing to a surge in pertussis diagnoses at the same time.

I was getting my degree in public health at the time and remembered talking about it a lot in classes and discussion sections. These were primarily ultraconservative religious groups that were opposed to vaccines already, but the Wakefield paper and the growing controversy made their decisions and beliefs seem more mainstream and palatable. This was also around the time that Jenny McCarthy started her ""activism"" and vaccine hesitancy, specifically around the measles, began to grow steam outside of those small ultraconservative groups.

Then there were several outbreaks througout the 2010s, primarily imported by migrants or visitors from the Phillippines but spread to unvaccinated-by-choice individuals here in the U.S. (the most famous of these was a measles outbreak in 2014 at Disneyland). This happened in pockets leading up to the COVID pandemic, where the already vaccine skeptical - who had been stewing in online echo chambers and closed communities for 20 years - introduced the same thinking to COVID vaccines. The rapid development of the vaccines, a modern medical miracle, was ironically a contributing factor to the distrust, as adults seem to be generally unaware that science advances over time.

You could tell the same story about the death of expertise and the rise of uneducated fringe idiots taking prominent positions in U.S. politics - that also seems new, but goes back to the Tea Party. I remember when we used to make fun of the Tea Party in the late 2000s/early 2010s because their ideas seemed so extreme and fringe, but if you look, much of their ideology has been absorbed into the mainstream GOP now.","14_1"

Most of these deaths will be infants and children. That butcher's bill will include a few vaccinated children with compromised immune systems.

Around 10% of measles cases develop severe but non-fatal complications, most of which are treatable and temporary. However, about one in 50 will develop permanent sight, hearing, or respiratory damage. Before vaccines, measles was the most significant cause of blindness and deafness in societies. A similar number will develop a form of encephalitis, which frequently results in seizures and - in extreme cases - developmental difficulties. A small number (less than one in ten thousand) will make a full recovery from measles only to die later from Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis, which is invariably fatal.

Meanwhile, the risks from the vaccine itself are incredibly remote. Like many vaccinations, the side effects are similar to those suffered by those with the disease, but at about 1/100th the frequency. Most will suffer no effects; a few may develop headaches, short-lived rashes, and temperatures. More severe complications (such as anaphylaxis) occur at a one-in-a-million rate. 

Despite the debunked claims of a disgraced scientist trying to discredit the MMR vaccine to establish a rival vaccine, people still associate vaccines with autism. This is entirely incorrect; increased instances of autism in societies have been repeatedly associated with andrological changes in men as they age (just as if a woman has a child in her 40s, the incidence of Trisomy 21 (or Downs Syndrome) increases, so the same applies to the age of the father at conception and the frequency of autism. Moreover, the brain states associated with ASD can be observed soon after birth and before any vaccination (two of the eight children in Andrew Wakefield's debunked survey were already exhibiting ASD symptoms before they were vaccinated). 

Most already know this, but if you are one of the cynical who think measles is trivial, all of these figures are based on years of data from before vaccination almost stamped out measles. And regrettably, from data after it came back.

In 1912, measles became a nationally notifiable disease in the United States, requiring U.S. healthcare providers and laboratories to report all diagnosed cases. In the first decade of reporting, an average of 6,000 measles-related deaths were reported each year.

A vaccine became available in 1963. In the decade before, nearly all children got measles by the time they were 15 years old. It is estimated 3 to 4 million people in the United States were infected each year. Among reported measles cases each year, an estimated:

400 to 500 people died
48,000 were hospitalized
1,000 suffered encephalitis (swelling of the brain)

In 1955 the US population was roughly 166 million people.  Now its somewhere around 333 million. Give or take. But for easy math, I just want to point out that if everyone were unvaccinated (LIKE HE WANTS) we would be looking at:

(Annually)

-6-8 million infections
-800-1000 deaths (mostly children)
-~96k hospitalizations
And about 2000 cases of encephalitis. 

Cool

So ... your kid gets measles. You have to stay home to care for them. But your employer fires you for taking too many days off. Now you're jobless. Even if you're in a state where that's technically illegal, DOGE is gutting labor protections, so good luck fighting it.

And then your kid is one of the ones (about a quarter of young kids) who needs to be hospitalized because of the measles. 

This is where you find out you have no health insurance, because you were fired. 

Oh, and thanks to DOGE it's all the more difficult to get processed for unemployment, or medicare, or SNAP benefits. So now you have no income, no food budget, you have medical bills you won't be able to pay off, which tanks your credit, which makes it harder to get a new job. Without your income, you can't pay rent, and get evicted, and you can't even get a new apartment with the bad credit, even when you do finally land another job.

I dunno, it just sounds so much easier to get vaccinated.","201"

Our midwives mostly dont talk politics at work, and they are very evidence based (maybe even more up on current research than the OBs at times), but our main midwife was so relieved when Trump won re-election. I havent heard her say ANYTHING about him since shit started hitting the fan this time around. 

The CRNA pulled up some video of Michelle Obama a few weeks ago that made fun of her looking like a man, and he shared that with all the nurses he was sitting with.

We had some staff respond almost aggressively in their line of questioning, and one quit on the spot. She now works in an ER. >#

Prior to that, when vaccines were available&we had nurses sitting at the front desk watching conspiracy theory videos pushing ivermectin, and I caught wind that there was a plan to walk out. I told the manager about it.  

But we live in a very conservative area, and most vote R, and it was bizarre to watch in real time people consume right wing media and bring that bias into the workplace, even affecting their own personal medical choices.

My antivax, 'covid is a hoax', next door neighbor died in 2022. Healthy man in his 50s. He was out cutting the graas, pruning, and working on his car on a Wednesday and was dead on Saturday. I didn't even know he was in the hospital on Friday. Anyhoo, his wife and family, and his church at the funeral, kept saying he had a cancerous skin lesion removed 5 years ago and never followed up afterwards. Claimed he died from metastasis.  Yeah, right. 

Easter was 2 months later and his wife called me the day before and asked if I had any of 'those covid home tests' and if I could show her how to use them. She thought she had a cold but wanted to make sure because her very elderly parents would be at their Easter thing. 

You'll never convince me Brent didn't die from covid. If they had said a heart attack, I would have believed them. But sudden and symptom-less metastasis? = They needed coaching on their chosen falsehood.","10"

The indictment charges certified nurse midwives Kathleen Breault and Kelly McDermott with conspiracy to defraud the United States.  The indictment alleges that McDermott, who owns Sage-Femme Midwifery PLLC, a midwife clinic in Albany, New York, and Breault, who worked at Sage-Femme, conspired to enroll Sage-Femme as an authorized COVID-19 vaccine administration site and to provide COVID-19 vaccination record cards to individuals who were not vaccinated, including minors who were not at the time eligible to be vaccinated and non-United States citizens who were not present in the United States when they were purportedly vaccinated.  The defendants allegedly destroyed vials of COVID-19 vaccines that were intended to be used to vaccinate patients. Even though Sage-Femme was a small midwife practice, the defendants fraud turned it into one of the busiest Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination sites in New York State, outpacing large, state-run vaccination sites.","16"

Medicaid was very interested in giving shots all together because it can be difficult to get patients in consistently for appointments.

For the measles vaccine to work, the body needs time to produce protective antibodies in response to the vaccine. Detectable antibodies generally appear within just a few days after vaccination.

I've been warning everyone I talk to, even the cashier at Kroger, to please look into a second shot.

Usually I don't just go out and ask people to get their vaccinations, but I have been working in bedside Healthcare since I was 20. I was there all through covid in one of the states that got hit hard. I got to see people die from a disease with an R0 of ~3.5, while measles has an R0 of ~15. For those who don't know, r0 is the rate of infection by one infected person. So for every one person with CoV 19, they would get 3 to 4 people infected. With measles, they get around 15 people infected. You risk encephalopathy, dehydration from diarrhea, pneumonia, and also risk catching other diseases while your immune system is compromised. If you survive, the worst thing can happen: immunity amnesia. Basically, your thymus' memory cells and immune system forget all of the diseases your body has fought, so you're starting from scratch. 

So while you're now immune to another measles infection, you're now highly suseptible to everything else. 

My experience with covid has given me some major PTSD. I'm in a wfh position now, and I'm not going back to the bedside for measles, bird flu, or Covid 2 electric boogaloo.","2_7"

If youre born in the US before 1957, youre almost guaranteed to have had measles and dont need a booster. 

If you were born later, you are less likely to have had measles since the vaccine quickly established herd immunity. In that case, you want to make sure you indeed had measles and not German measles (Rubella) or another rash causing disease (e.g. Rubeola) before you think youre immune. ","29_2"

Both rubella and mumps have a slightly lower herd immunity threshold than measles and are less infectious. However, going the way were going, we should see outbreaks of these as well. 

Anyone worried about their immunity should 1. Talk to their doctor 2. Get a titer or 3. Get a booster. 

The only barrier for number three is cost. Barring allergies, theres no downside to getting a booster. In the worst case, it does nothing because youre already immune.

Risk for adults if unvaccinated include complications akin to other viral respiratory infections including pneumonia (rate not to different than flu or Rsv). There is a &lt;0.1% chance of encephalitis.

The bigger issue with measles is the high incidence of severe pathology (including SSPE) in kids who are unvaccinated and under 2.. (keep in mind everyone under 1 is unvaccinated, though 0-3 months May have some protection from Mom)

 Time and effort is better spent getting the unvaccinated community on board, which in my experience works best by having an honest discussion about risks.

As an aside... Titers are trash and not a reliable way to ""double check"" if youre immunte. Just because your titer is negative doesn't mean you aren't immune.

And yes, preachers can be the worst 

I had somebody who's going on and on about their God being so wonderful and I asked if Their God was sending these diseases and it was oh yeah God sending this stuff. God is doing this to try our faith in him.

Best explanation Ive seen so far:

Lets try to simplify what you are really saying for those who arent super familiar with our educational system. 

Greg Abbott: We want to offer school choice because the gap between our highest and our lowest achieving students is getting bigger. Any child can attend a private school if they choose. 

Family A: Awesome! My child already attends a private school because I am rich and can afford it! The voucher now gives me a $10,000 discount on what Im already paying! 

Abbott: Youre welcome! 

Family B: Awesome! $10,000 is great, but our school choice costs $20,000 a year. How do I pay the rest?

Abbott: Since your child has great test scores, the school will give them a scholarship to cover the rest of the cost. 

Family C: Awesome! $10,000 is great, but our school choice costs $20,000 a year. How do I pay the rest?

Abbott: Since your child didnt have the best test scores, its not our problem. Go to the now underfunded public school. 

Family D: Awesome! But, my child has autism and the private school doesnt have any programs to deal with that. 

Abbott: Not my problem. Go to the now underfunded public school. 

Family E: So awesome! What time will the bus be by to pick up my child?

Abbott: It wont, but its not my problem. Go to the now underfunded public school. 

Family F: Awesome! But, my child has an IEP for his special needs and our school of choice doesnt have programs to help him. 

Abbott: Not my problem. Go to the now underfunded public school. 

Public School: How is taking only high test scorers with no special needs who can provide their own transportation (which usually equates to being middle or upper class) going to shrink the gap between the highest and lowest achieving students? 

Abbott: Not my problem. Do more with less. Im just happy that my rich donors are now happy with their discount and I know my kid doesnt have to sit next to a poor kid or one with a learning disability in class. Win-win for everyone! By the way, your special education student test scores WILL be counted towards your school test score average. 

Public Schools: Thats not really fair. Thats not comparing apples to apples since the private schools dont have to accept kids who bring down their test score average. 

Abbott: Not my problem. We will continue to make it look like YOU are the biggest failure in the world.","9"

1. She went to a Peking med school '93. Although I am a doc I have never heard of anyone in 50 years since college having gone there. ? why. If you did not get in to a continental school generally you went to Mexico or the Caribbean. Why China? It may be obvious but not to me. 

2. She is Board certified by a board set up to bypass the pain in the ass that the traditional board, the ABMS, setup for continuing certification. Like Rand Paul's Board this has its adherents and detractors for legitimacy. Choosing this board for certification seems as much political as functional. You can guess my stand on this.

3. Where are her reviews? I am retired for 8 years and still have 10-15 reviews on these sites (including the one who gave me a 1 because I told her to lose weight to help her knees work better-sometimes it's replace or lose weight). Doc has 0-8 and some of them appear to result from her testimony, not her doctoring. Weird, she should have dozens having practiced for 20+years.

A natural experiment occurs when an external event or policy change creates conditions that resemble a controlled experiment, even though the researchers didnt set it up intentionally. Epidemiologists and social scientists often use natural experiments to analyze the effects of exposures (like pollution, diseases, or public health policies) when randomized controlled trials would be impractical or unethical.

For example, the Chernobyl disaster provided a natural experiment for studying the effects of radiation exposure on human health. Another famous example is John Snows 1854 cholera study in London, where differences in water supply sources unintentionally created conditions that allowed him to demonstrate that cholera was waterborne.","41"

It's a faith in a God that enters into the suffering alongside creation, experiences it, and defeats it by identifying within it. 
  
""God sustains us in all things, but prevents no suffering"" is how I understand Christ. 

But like, I fuck with Meister Eckart, Teresa of Avila, St. John of the Cross, Thomas Merton, and people like that. 

I really fucking despise (yeah I know. It's a weakness) people who take the name of Christ and use it to sign off on denying Christ in other people.

(These are also the same folks that swear that there is a war on Christmas, btw)

And it's crazy when these folks pontificate about how great their faith is while systematically discriminating against people because their skin colour or their country of origin or for believing in the 'wrong' version of Christ. But for a country which has so many extra bibles they put them in hotel rooms for storage\* I feel like some of these 'super Christians' might be better off if they read the book and listened to what Jesus actually said instead of what their preacher/priest/minister tells them he meant or whatever they need to justify their bad behaviour.

Abbott and his stupid stooges are fighting for that. The net will only tighten when they get to the point of ""which Xtian groups are bad"" and Texas isn't there yet.

Part of why so many Mennonites are there (or cults in general like the FLDS compound from ~20+ years ago, google Warren Jeffs for that one) is the state only cares about truancy from school until you claim ""homeschooling"" and suddenly they don't give a fuck. They don't even keep track of the kids, so in cult/abusive families, it's easier for the abuse to thrive cause there's basically no check in so it's much easier to completely isolate their children. There's suddenly no mandatory reporters! Add in keeping away from medical care for routine stuff and that drops encountering mandatory reporters to near impossible.

It's why things like the Homeschool Coalition are big in Texas and religious ""homeschool curriculum"" that are actually pitiful and chock-full of falsehoods have expos across Texas every year. It allows parents to dominate their children and most won't be able to hack it in college from the piss poor educational foundation they were forced to have.

I'd hope that the kids have a chance to break free: but Seminole is poor as fuck, quite isolated, and so the children won't have the chance to easily broaden their horizons unless they are an individual with natural burning curiosity that is willing to fight like hell to get out of that dusty pond. And those individuals are people that end up targeted because they are different from the herd. And out of that ""different"" group, most would rather pop their head back down than risk getting whacked by the hammer of local authority.

Basically, the odds aren't in their favor...","24_2"

The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella.

The next-lowest number for MMR vaccination rate in North Texas was 38.10% at Collin County Cornerstone Christian Academy.

Most North Texas schools and districts have vaccination rates above 75%, and numerous vaccination rates are in the upper 90% range. About 62 North Texas schools had a 100% vaccination rate among kindergartners in the 2023-2024 school year.

""So shoutout to MC Prep for being the least vaccinated school in Texas,"" Schott said in his video. ""We'll take it. Or as Mercy Culture says, we celebrate it. We'll put it on the board.""

While the measles outbreak was mostly limited to West Texas  there was one case confirmed in an adult in North Texas (Rockwall County)  public health officials and doctors warned that vaccination is the best defense against spreading the rare virus.

Measles is ""probably the most infectious contagious disease on the planet,"" said Dr. Suzanne Whitworth, division chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Cook Children's in Fort Worth previously told WFAA. ""We know that about 40% of kids under the age of five who get measles are gonna wind up in the hospital, and nobody wants that.""","1"

 - SSPE affects approximately 1 in 100,000 measles cases globally.
 - Mortality rates exceed 95%, with spontaneous remission being extremely rare.
 - No cure exists for SSPE.
 - Management focuses on supportive care and symptom control using anticonvulsants and antispasmodic drugs.
 - Males are more frequently affected than females.
 - It typically develops 710 years after the initial measles infection, often in children or adolescents, and is nearly always fatal within 13 years of diagnosis.
 - The disease is more common in individuals who contracted measles before the age of 2.
 - Its incidence has declined in high-income countries due to widespread vaccination..... But when vaccination rates go down, the number of people who die from this preventable disease goes up.","1_3"

Well, it would be laughable if it didnt put real people, especially kids, in harms way.  

The Measles vaccine was introduced in 1963.  This was a time when you could strongly argue that both diet and health (which Im taking to mean more physically active and fit) were much better than today.  Processed and fast food were popular but both were not consumed at levels you see today.  It was also a pre internet/less TV screen time era where outdoor activity and play was more the norm for kids.  

In 1963 the US had [385,156](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-measles-cases?tab=table&amp;time=1963..latest) cases.  By 1968, when an improved version of the vaccine came out, cases had dropped to 22,231.  Cases continued to trend downward all the way to 2007 where cases hit 43 US cases.   

From 1968 to 2007 you will probably find that less physical activity and processed/fast food became more and more the norm even as case numbers continue to fall.   

If food and health were the key then, if anything,  you would expect to see cases steadily rise each year as food and diet declined.  

In fact cases have been on the rise lately mainly due to vaccine rates dropping.  

The man is a moron, and it will continue to cost people lives.","9"

Also, This book which thoroughly and conclusively documented all the mountains and mountains of evidence that Wuhan constitute of Virology was making Covid like viruses, they had the means, will, opportunity and it blew up right in their area after some of their employees got sick. That is the least convincing evidence in the book. It's filled with mind blowing facts about the biological capabilities to alter Covid viruses without traces of genetic engineering. They called it the ""no see-um"" technique. They had cages filled with infected bats with various strains. They took those strains and allowed them to spread an evolve in humanized mice. By humanized, I mean genetically engineered mice which make the human ACE2 cmreceptor. This is the same receptor Covid binds to.  Read the book if you have courage to learn you are wrong.

Fauci and the ""proximal origins"" theory paper was a fraud. Just before that paper, Fauci emails show the authors all had a secret meeting, not inviting CDC director Robert Redfield and the meeting conclusion was that they need to downplay the lab leak theory for the sake of science and global harmony.

""I now agree with Nicks central conclusion: We still do not know the source of this awful pandemic. We may never know. But the argument that it could have leaked out of the Wuhan Institute of Virology or a sister lab in Wuhan has become considerably stronger than it was a year ago, when the screaming was so loud that it drowned out serious discussion.""



""So there we are. All we have so far is speculation, and all the explanations are unsatisfactory. The whole thing may just be a cold case, and stay that way forever. But there are more embers left to sift. The whole world, China included, needs a hard answer, whoever is to blame  so we can prevent this from happening again.""



He doesn't share your certainty. He presents a case for the wet market as well as a case for the lab leak. He actually seems to be more in alignment with me and Dr Fauci, than he does you.

So science-deniers will kill a bunch of people in countries who never had a vote as well.

Also, just giving you an Ontario-based view of our province's Covid vaccine rollout, most of my friends were double vaxxed months before anyone in Canada got a shot at being vaccinated.  I was online hitting refresh for literal hours trying to secure a slot for my family to get vaccines when they first started to roll out.  We're a small market, we had to wait in line for Covid shots and I'm sure the same will be true if bird flu goes pandemic.  Once there's ample supply, I'm pretty sure you could easily buy a vaccine at a Canadian pharmacy if you showed up.  But please, although you're probably kidding anyhow, the Canadian population is a fraction of the US population.  If Americans of means started crossing the border to get vaccinated, that would quickly use up the supply our government bought for our citizens.  If you want the opportunity to skip over to Canada for a vaccine (or anything else) in the future, we would be happy to share once our citizens have had the opportunity to be vaccinated.

 Ironically, these are often the same people who vote against food security, child care, safe affordable housing, parental leave, health care - all the Jesus things people need to make the choice to have children. These are often the same folks who support the death penalty even though their religion does not.  

The people who use religion as an excuse appear to cherry pick the bible so it fits their specific desires. 

So the hypocrisy is strong and makes one wonder if they just want to slough off the protection their children need - which requires a percentage of people to be vaccinated - on to someone else's kids. 

Many Catholics used this as an excuse even though their spiritual leader ( picked by God ) says vaccination is a moral obligation.

No major religion prohibits vaccines. But of course the danger of religion is that you get to create God in your own image. Even Evangelical religions do not prohibit, but people will say it does. 

https://www.lohud.com/story/news/2021/09/24/covid-19-few-religions-have-doctrinal-reasons-avoid-vaccine/5801570001/

Once again , unless people follow all the tenets of a religion, 
I suspect they are just being selfish and foisting protection on others. 

&gt;Many such objections are pretextual: in Australia, anti-vaccinationists founded the Church of Conscious Living, a ""fake church"",[4] leading to religious exemptions being removed in that country, and one US pastor was reported to offer vaccine exemptions in exchange for online membership of his church.[5]

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination_and_religion

Some religions insist you and your children must suffer and die rather than use medicine or blood transfusions. Jehovah's witnesses, Christian scientists, some Orthodox Jewish sects. 

Vaccines and fetal cells lines : 

&gt;No, the COVID-19 vaccines do not contain aborted fetal cells. However, Johnson &amp; Johnson did use fetal cell lines  not fetal tissue  when developing and producing their vaccine, while Pfizer and Moderna used fetal cell lines to test their vaccines and make sure that they work.

&gt;Fetal cell lines are grown in a laboratory and were started with cells from elective abortions that occurred several decades ago in the 1970s-80s. They are now thousands of generations removed from the original fetal tissue. None of the COVID-19 vaccines use fetal cells derived from recent abortions.

""Titers measure antibodies in your blood but dont account for T cell and B cell immunity, which also protect you.

T cell and B cell memory are particularly important because once measles enters your body, it doesnt replicate that fast. It is slow enough that if you get infected, they will start pumping out antibodies to prevent you from getting sick. This means that a negative result on titers does not necessarily mean you are not protected.

That was complete news to me - I didn't know that people like that existed and naively thought people would line up for miles to get vaccinated as soon as one was developed, so we could stop living in that weird, scary isolationland of 2020 and 2021).

And then because I was an irresponsible twit and dropped out, when I went back to college at a different school a decade later I also didn't have a copy of my record, and had to redo every shot that wasn't in the national database. Which IIRC was DTaP and MMR. 

And then when I went to grad school in another state, I found out that not only had the previous clinic not bothered to enter them in the database, but the new state required a vaccination that I don't remember getting (HepB). The vaccination clinic I was at offered to do titers for me, but they cost three times as much as the shots and weren't guaranteed. So I got another DTaP, MMR and HepB.

Also I was wrong before, in a way that explains why I kept having to get new shots - there is no *national* database for vaccine records, just state databases. So the clinics could find some of my records, but not others. 

But like, I got a bunch of booster shots in random ways, too. For example, as a student I would go to a free clinic for a pap smear and birth control and they would be like, ""Hey, we have a bunch of free vaccines we got as part of a grant, how about a tetanus booster?""

Yet at the same time we are told immunity wanes over time.  Some pretty quickly like covid, and  over a greater period of time for other diseases.

Sure older people didn't get measles.  

1.  Prior to vaccines it was assumed everyone older had been infected so they were immune.   

2. Once we had vaccines that were highly effective and the number of cases was dropping, older people would be protected by herd immunity, as well as potential natural immunity.

Basically, we are assuming it is lifetime immunity.   

The chart missed the individuals from 1957 to 1963.

I am in favor of the extra dose if you are at all unsure and are in the age group prior to two doses required for school.

[Even the CDC says that ""experts aren't sure why"" the MMR may fail in some adults](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html#:~:text=Very%20few%20people%E2%80%94about%20three,or%20have%20weakened%20immune%20systems):

&gt;Very few peopleabout three out of 100who get two doses of measles vaccine will still get measles if exposed to the virus. Experts arent sure why. It could be that their immune systems didnt respond as well as they should have to the vaccine. But the good news is, fully vaccinated people who get measles seem more likely to have a milder illness. And fully vaccinated people seem also less likely to spread the disease to other people, including people who cant get vaccinated because they are too young or have weakened immune systems.

If virtually all failure was due to being immunocompromised, wouldn't they just say that?","95_1_1_1_1"

I have a severe phobia of being stuck with needles, and always request extra people to hold me down if I have to get stuck.  (I fought like a wolverine when I was younger, but now as long as I can feel someone holding down both legs and someone pressing my shoulders back against the table/bed, I can get through it.)  FYI, hospitals to NOT like when you say, youre gonna need extra people when they come at you with a needle.  I once had a nurse call security because she thought I was threatening them, and I felt terrible.  (I was in mental health crisis at the time, so understandable, but I started crying, apologizing, and explaining my meaning, because I absolutely wasnt threatening them).

This is the ONLY reason I never got the COVID shot, and never get flu shots - I cant handle injections without extreme measures.  (I also dont have insurance, so it would be at a random, very public place with long lines.  My social anxiety cant even.)  But, I stay out of public generally (I go to work - thats it 99% of the time, and my workspace is very isolated and I rarely have interactions with the public) and happily mask up and keep my distance from others.

I was so worried Id need an MMR booster (got my last one in 1994, and I elbowed one nurse in the face and kicked another in my histrionics of sheer terror) because I live in a very red, very anti-vax place.  Im 44, and I dont know if measles is like chicken pox where its worse when youre older, but was concerned I could catch it somehow.  (I did have chicken pox, in 1989, when I was in 2nd grade.  First ones appeared on the palm of my hand, which isnt the normal presentation at all.  I dont remember being sick feeling, but do remember the itching and not being able to scratch.  Totally worth the two weeks off school, though! haha)

Funnily enough, I have many tattoos.  For some reason, I can sit through 8hrs of tattooing but will shriek in terror and cling to the ceiling if someone comes at me with a hypodermic.  But I have no piercings, due to the stabbing with a needle issue.

I wish they could do vaccines without the need for injection.  Id eat or swallow something gross, or have something gross smeared on a cut/small open wound to my body (the original vaccine!), as I also have dermatophagia and often have open wounds on my fingers (or Ill chew a new one, no problem!).  I only got a tetanus shot because I was nearly killed in a car wreck and was in a coma for two weeks, so they gave it to me then.  I had to kick and scream at the top of my lungs to get the nurse to not to give me a heparin shot the first day I was awake, as she did not respect my autonomy when I said, I dont want that.  (Again, not scared of the medicine, just the needle.  Plus, I didnt want to pay for it.)  That same nurse just expected me to swallow pills without telling me what they were or why I needed them.  I asked, she said, just take them.  Again, not scared of medicine, but did want to know what they were giving me, after seeing how much fentanyl, ketamine, and morphine they kept me dosed up with when I thumbed through my medical records while awake in the hospital bed.  (Am afraid of those.  I dont like opiates, they make me sick.)

It sounds cruel, but at least the American gene pool will get a much needed dose of chlorine.  Children will die, but at least it cuts off that LeGaCy so absolute stupidity it isnt proliferated in the human race.

Edit to add: Im team mudblood because I support the vaccine, and wish I had been given it in the hospital during my extended stay during COVID in 2022.  But red anti-vax state.  They didnt even ask.  I would have preferred it, as they could have given it to me with the tetanus shot I got without consent during my coma.","96"

How the wealthy cut the line during Florida's frenzied vaccine rollout

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-covid-vaccine-ron-de-santis-60-minutes-2021-04-04/

In West Palm Beach, Mayor James says he was still trying to secure vaccines for his town's firefighters when he learned that at a nursing home in town, some board members and their wealthy pals got vaccinated. Even though those doses were only supposed to be given to elderly residents and staff.

Then, the private jets started arriving.

Hollywood moguls, New York socialites and tourists from overseas were getting vaccinated in Florida, posting on social media and sparking outrage. Early on, there were no residency requirements to get vaccinated in the state.

Keith James: People were saying, ""Listen, this is a resource and I know it's out there and I'm gonna use whatever leverage I have to get that resource."" There were no rules.

Sharyn Alfonsi: It sounds like ""The Hunger Games.""

Keith James: That's a pretty good way of putting it. And those who had the fiscal resources were gonna use them in whatever way they could to get this vaccine.

That figure stood at just 3,000 two years ago.
&gt;

I'd bet good money that even that last number is far too low.

&gt; Young people who contract long Covid before entering the workforce also face difficulties. They often do not qualify for WIA and must apply for the Wajong disability benefit. However, Wajong is only granted to individuals deemed permanently unable to work. Insurance doctors hesitate to make that determination, leaving many young, sick people in serious financial trouble, Nelck said.

To add to that: 

* The massive pool of individuals who don't realize that their health issues are actually long COVID and aren't marked as LC patients
* The elderly that are already retired aren't reflected in these numbers
* The ~50 extra deaths/day we've had since 2020 aren't counted in LC stats either, because they got a more permanent solution

And then there's the group where everyone is walking around with a stamp card, getting a new stamp for every infection, and a free mystery gift is awarded to them when they fill up the card.

My neighbor is 85, and as sound mentally as ever (brilliant, yet quirky). He claims to be libertarian. He also pays too much attention to Fox News. He now believes the Covid vaccines are bad, but his out of town kids have done their best to get him vaccinated. And he's struggling financially.

He complained that his Medicare supplement had gone up by $90, to $395 a month, and I knew that was high. I went to Medicare.gov and printed out 14 choices, 12 of which were cheaper than his, with one $150 cheaper. 

I brought it over with a note, recommending that he go to the local senior services agency to discuss this (even though all he had to do was get on the phone and call the companies).

He couldn't handle what I was bringing to him, so then he started to vent. He told me that during the 10 years that he lived in Holland, they had a system where everybody was required to buy private health insurance, with some people getting subsidies from the government, and that worked great over there. And he said that Trump was going to fix our system. !!!!!!

I didn't mention to him that we have already tried that in this country, and that as an example, 50% of Medicare recipients are covered by private insurance (Medicare Advantage plans). And that Advantage plans actually cost the government more than traditional Medicare. Medicare has the lowest admin costs of any health insurance.

In any case, he next told me that he gets $295 a month as a food allowance, and how great he thinks that is. I didn't tell him that Trump and the Republican Congress could very well reduce or delete that program. He'll complain if that is taken away, too.

This is an Ivy league educated man. Well read and intelligent and not by any means a bad guy.

It amazes me how people don't make the connection between how the Republican platform that they so staunchly support directly hurts them. The Blue States' taxes support the Red States that hate government taxes so much. We have to remember, however, that at least 30 or 40 percent of any Red state votes Democratic, however. (And that 30 to 40% of any Blue state votes Republican).

And doing it from a bully pulpit and telling our neighbors how insignificant they are isn't helping the US.

A client who was buying steel from Canada ate part of the cost and passed some of it along to his customers during the last round of tariffs. I did some research, and during the last round of tariffs, steel producers in the US didn't increase production, but they did raise prices, because they could. I looked up steel production in the US, and industry is at just under 75% capacity, which means they can only add a little more (factories normally can't run at more than 80% due to a variety of factors that I won't try to explain here), so there is a very small amount of production that steel mills could add without building new mills, which couldn't even open before Trump is out of office.

I have relatives in Canada and my kids are dual citizens. When my son has his first child (they're hoping to have one in a year or two), he wants to have the baby born in Canada, because it will be cheaper. Also, the baby can then be a dual citizen.

The UK has a working population of 34m according to a search, so an increase of 1m people on disability is ... not great.

&gt; As ministers prepare more than £5 billion of cuts to disability benefits to control rising spending, the analysis warned that there was compelling evidence of a real decline in mental health since the pandemic, including a rise in deaths of despair.

&gt; Sir Keir Starmer told Labour MPs on Monday that the increase in younger people out of work on sickness benefits was unsustainable, indefensible and unfair as he promised to be ruthless about reforming the system.

People are sick. They need money to survive. More sick people cost more money. So what we do is cut their aid so we can save money, because ""the increase in younger people out of work on sickness benefits was 'unsustainable, indefensible and unfair.'""

I didn't even know he was in the hospital on Friday. Anyhoo, his wife and family, and his church at the funeral, kept saying he had a cancerous skin lesion removed 5 years ago and never followed up afterwards. Claimed he died from metastasis.  Yeah, right. 

Easter was 2 months later and his wife called me the day before and asked if I had any of 'those covid home tests' and if I could show her how to use them. She thought she had a cold but wanted to make sure because her very elderly parents would be at their Easter thing. 

You'll never convince me Brent didn't die from covid. If they had said a heart attack, I would have believed them. But sudden and symptom-less metastasis? = They needed coaching on their chosen falsehood.","10"

The indictment charges certified nurse midwives Kathleen Breault and Kelly McDermott with conspiracy to defraud the United States.  The indictment alleges that McDermott, who owns Sage-Femme Midwifery PLLC, a midwife clinic in Albany, New York, and Breault, who worked at Sage-Femme, conspired to enroll Sage-Femme as an authorized COVID-19 vaccine administration site and to provide COVID-19 vaccination record cards to individuals who were not vaccinated, including minors who were not at the time eligible to be vaccinated and non-United States citizens who were not present in the United States when they were purportedly vaccinated.  The defendants allegedly destroyed vials of COVID-19 vaccines that were intended to be used to vaccinate patients. Even though Sage-Femme was a small midwife practice, the defendants fraud turned it into one of the busiest Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination sites in New York State, outpacing large, state-run vaccination sites.","16"

I've been warning everyone I talk to, even the cashier at Kroger, to please look into a second shot.

Usually I don't just go out and ask people to get their vaccinations, but I have been working in bedside Healthcare since I was 20. I was there all through covid in one of the states that got hit hard. I got to see people die from a disease with an R0 of ~3.5, while measles has an R0 of ~15. For those who don't know, r0 is the rate of infection by one infected person. So for every one person with CoV 19, they would get 3 to 4 people infected. With measles, they get around 15 people infected. You risk encephalopathy, dehydration from diarrhea, pneumonia, and also risk catching other diseases while your immune system is compromised. If you survive, the worst thing can happen: immunity amnesia. Basically, your thymus' memory cells and immune system forget all of the diseases your body has fought, so you're starting from scratch. 

So while you're now immune to another measles infection, you're now highly suseptible to everything else. 

My experience with covid has given me some major PTSD. I'm in a wfh position now, and I'm not going back to the bedside for measles, bird flu, or Covid 2 electric boogaloo.","2_7"

Both rubella and mumps have a slightly lower herd immunity threshold than measles and are less infectious. However, going the way were going, we should see outbreaks of these as well. 

Anyone worried about their immunity should 1. Talk to their doctor 2. Get a titer or 3. Get a booster. 

The only barrier for number three is cost. Barring allergies, theres no downside to getting a booster. In the worst case, it does nothing because youre already immune.

1. Its cool that they went that far to check rather than rely on a paper trail. 

2. I was 1-2 months from getting out. They could have just let me go along my way. But they put this check in to ensure I had everything in a manner that FORCED it on me.

We hospitalize a lot of measles cases in the US without good reason, basically just because they have measles. 

Risk for adults if unvaccinated include complications akin to other viral respiratory infections including pneumonia (rate not to different than flu or Rsv). There is a &lt;0.1% chance of encephalitis.

The bigger issue with measles is the high incidence of severe pathology (including SSPE) in kids who are unvaccinated and under 2.. (keep in mind everyone under 1 is unvaccinated, though 0-3 months May have some protection from Mom)

 Time and effort is better spent getting the unvaccinated community on board, which in my experience works best by having an honest discussion about risks.

As an aside... Titers are trash and not a reliable way to ""double check"" if youre immunte. Just because your titer is negative doesn't mean you aren't immune. Antibody-mediated immunity is only part of the story. Cell-mediated (CD4) immunity plays a large role and is infeasible for routine testing.","96"

""Titers measure antibodies in your blood but dont account for T cell and B cell immunity, which also protect you.

T cell and B cell memory are particularly important because once measles enters your body, it doesnt replicate that fast. It is slow enough that if you get infected, they will start pumping out antibodies to prevent you from getting sick. This means that a negative result on titers does not necessarily mean you are not protected.

The vaccination clinic I was at offered to do titers for me, but they cost three times as much as the shots and weren't guaranteed. So I got another DTaP, MMR and HepB.

Getting unnecessary boosters doesn't hurt at all. Well, not more than a sore lump on your arm for a few days.","16"

Prior to that, vaccines were just required for the first time a kid entered school. Presumably if the kid moved or switched schools, they would have to prove to the new school that they were vaccinated. 

Also I was wrong before, in a way that explains why I kept having to get new shots - there is no *national* database for vaccine records, just state databases. So the clinics could find some of my records, but not others. 

But like, I got a bunch of booster shots in random ways, too. For example, as a student I would go to a free clinic for a pap smear and birth control and they would be like, ""Hey, we have a bunch of free vaccines we got as part of a grant, how about a tetanus booster?""

Yet at the same time we are told immunity wanes over time.  Some pretty quickly like covid, and  over a greater period of time for other diseases.

Sure older people didn't get measles.  

1.  Prior to vaccines it was assumed everyone older had been infected so they were immune.   

2. Once we had vaccines that were highly effective and the number of cases was dropping, older people would be protected by herd immunity, as well as potential natural immunity.

Basically, we are assuming it is lifetime immunity.   

The chart missed the individuals from 1957 to 1963.

I am in favor of the extra dose if you are at all unsure and are in the age group prior to two doses required for school.

&gt;Very few peopleabout three out of 100who get two doses of measles vaccine will still get measles if exposed to the virus. Experts arent sure why. It could be that their immune systems didnt respond as well as they should have to the vaccine. But the good news is, fully vaccinated people who get measles seem more likely to have a milder illness. And fully vaccinated people seem also less likely to spread the disease to other people, including people who cant get vaccinated because they are too young or have weakened immune systems.

If virtually all failure was due to being immunocompromised, wouldn't they just say that?","95_1_1_1_1"

I have a severe phobia of being stuck with needles, and always request extra people to hold me down if I have to get stuck.  (I fought like a wolverine when I was younger, but now as long as I can feel someone holding down both legs and someone pressing my shoulders back against the table/bed, I can get through it.)  FYI, hospitals to NOT like when you say, youre gonna need extra people when they come at you with a needle.  I once had a nurse call security because she thought I was threatening them, and I felt terrible.  (I was in mental health crisis at the time, so understandable, but I started crying, apologizing, and explaining my meaning, because I absolutely wasnt threatening them).

This is the ONLY reason I never got the COVID shot, and never get flu shots - I cant handle injections without extreme measures.  (I also dont have insurance, so it would be at a random, very public place with long lines.  My social anxiety cant even.)  But, I stay out of public generally (I go to work - thats it 99% of the time, and my workspace is very isolated and I rarely have interactions with the public) and happily mask up and keep my distance from others.

I was so worried Id need an MMR booster (got my last one in 1994, and I elbowed one nurse in the face and kicked another in my histrionics of sheer terror) because I live in a very red, very anti-vax place.  Im 44, and I dont know if measles is like chicken pox where its worse when youre older, but was concerned I could catch it somehow.  (I did have chicken pox, in 1989, when I was in 2nd grade.  First ones appeared on the palm of my hand, which isnt the normal presentation at all.  I dont remember being sick feeling, but do remember the itching and not being able to scratch.  Totally worth the two weeks off school, though! haha)

Funnily enough, I have many tattoos.  For some reason, I can sit through 8hrs of tattooing but will shriek in terror and cling to the ceiling if someone comes at me with a hypodermic.  But I have no piercings, due to the stabbing with a needle issue.

I wish they could do vaccines without the need for injection.  Id eat or swallow something gross, or have something gross smeared on a cut/small open wound to my body (the original vaccine!), as I also have dermatophagia and often have open wounds on my fingers (or Ill chew a new one, no problem!).  I only got a tetanus shot because I was nearly killed in a car wreck and was in a coma for two weeks, so they gave it to me then.  I had to kick and scream at the top of my lungs to get the nurse to not to give me a heparin shot the first day I was awake, as she did not respect my autonomy when I said, I dont want that.  (Again, not scared of the medicine, just the needle.  Plus, I didnt want to pay for it.)  That same nurse just expected me to swallow pills without telling me what they were or why I needed them.  I asked, she said, just take them.  Again, not scared of medicine, but did want to know what they were giving me, after seeing how much fentanyl, ketamine, and morphine they kept me dosed up with when I thumbed through my medical records while awake in the hospital bed.  (Am afraid of those.  I dont like opiates, they make me sick.)

It sounds cruel, but at least the American gene pool will get a much needed dose of chlorine.  Children will die, but at least it cuts off that LeGaCy so absolute stupidity it isnt proliferated in the human race.

Edit to add: Im team mudblood because I support the vaccine, and wish I had been given it in the hospital during my extended stay during COVID in 2022.  But red anti-vax state.  They didnt even ask.  I would have preferred it, as they could have given it to me with the tetanus shot I got without consent during my coma.","96"

and while there have yet to be studies on the effects on lowering cognitive abilities affecting emotional self control I suspect the worstening state of people's behavior is not just political with certain people and groups giving them permission to be their worst selves. it's is some sort of brain damage to the bits handling self control so they let out all the racism, sexism, anti certain religions or sects, just all around nastiness. general bad behavior, more like brain of a child before learning to control impulses. of course made worse by politicans and social media influencing those behaviors, is a horrible combination","1_1_2"
