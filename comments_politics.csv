I voted for Trump and then moved to Palm Beach. I would take my kids to the aquarium, only to find myself stepping over Nazi flags while police officers stood by, doing nothing as people openly spewed hate and violence. It was a shocking reality for me.

Then came the push to ban books and censor discussions of race and history, prompting many teachers to resign. When extremist groups began appearing on my block, the police wouldnt even respond.

During the January 6th insurrection, I told my wife that people would inevitably die thereand sadly, they did. The backlash against BLM and diversity efforts that followed shattered my understanding of what I once believed about freedom.

When I dared to question Trumps claims about the election or the pandemic, I was met with studies, data, and a deeper understanding of democracy and public health than I had ever considered. I asked my wife, How is this culture even possible here? Her response was simple: Maybe try listening.

I spent months researching and watching Trumps remarks in their full context, only to realize I had been duped. Now, I find myself reflecting on how I was manipulated for the first 45 years of my life by media that played on my fears rather than my empathy. I actually felt my brain do a somersault when it all hit me. I truly understand what it means to think critically now.","55"

This is [House Bill 371](https://legiscan.com/MT/text/HB371/id/3094816) from the **Montana** House of Representatives, not the U.S. House of Representatives. If passed, it would only affect the law in Montana.

The VAERS system, managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), collects data on vaccine side effects.


As of February 2025, VAERS has recorded over 20,000 reports of death after vaccination, but this includes all vaccines (COVID-19 and others), and many of these deaths were not directly caused by the vaccine.


Of these reports, the CDC and FDA have consistently found that most deaths were due to pre-existing conditions or natural causes unrelated to the vaccine, such as heart disease, cancer, or old age.
Investigations into death reports: According to CDC data, the CDCs clinical review and investigations consistently show no causal link between most deaths and the vaccines, especially for COVID-19 vaccines.


2. Death Rate Relative to Vaccine Doses Administered
COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) have been administered worldwide to over 13 billion doses (as of early 2025). The number of deaths reported post-vaccination is extremely low compared to the number of doses given.


According to VAERS, the death rate following vaccination is about 1-2 deaths per million doses for both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. This is well below the general death rate seen in the population, and the vast majority of these cases are thoroughly investigated to rule out any connection to the vaccine.


3. Risk of Death from COVID-19 vs. Vaccination
The risk of dying from COVID-19 is significantly higher than the risk of dying from a vaccine side effect. The death rate from COVID-19 varies by age, underlying health conditions, and other factors, but studies show that unvaccinated individuals are much more likely to die from COVID-19 than those who are vaccinated.


4. Global Data
Data from other countries, such as Europes EudraVigilance and the WHOs VigiBase, also track vaccine safety and adverse events. Like VAERS, these systems report that most deaths after vaccination are due to other factors and not directly caused by the vaccine.


5. Conclusion
While reports of deaths after receiving the vaccine do exist, they are extremely rare in comparison to the millions of doses administered. Health agencies around the world have reviewed these reports and consistently find that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks.


The CDC and FDA emphasize that vaccination remains the safest and most effective way to prevent severe illness and death from COVID-19.","139"

Bird flu H5N1 has been spreading quickly not just among birds (forcing the culling of bird flocks and hence raising egg prices) but jumping to other animals including mammals.  And now even from mammal to human.  Serious illnesses and a death have even occurred.

But, we had two weapons against the virus.  Public health workers investigating and reporting data weekly on the virus.  And, if a pandemic strain does arrive, we have the ability now to relatively quickly develop a vaccine against a particular strain with mRNA technology.

Now theyre gone.  Public health has been ordered silent from communications.  Money and activity is being frozen.  And now, Republicans are letting the anti-vax crowd run amok by introducing legislation and confirming the biggest vax denialist as leader of our public health.

But RFK Jr. is most likely going to be the one personnell decision that will turn out to be the deadliest for everyday Americans. He's a regressive, unscientific whack who's in a position that gives him way too much influence over an area that has been part of the foundation of the US' prosperity. One can't overstate how important vaccines and general health education are. This might become highly inaccessible to the average US citizen.

I can think of at least two broad ways that this advances the MAGA agenda. Not the stated agenda but the actual agenda.

1. Revenge. Trump in particular and MAGA in general have shown a strong preference for attacking anything and everything associated with people/groups who have stood up to them. Trump and MAGA feel that the medical establishment turned on them during COVID and cuts at CDC, NIH, etc. along with anti-vax measures are designed to outrage them.

2. Institutional destabilization. The MAGA movement wants to be the sole source of truth and power in the country. Every institution with independent expertise and values must be undermined and degraded so that the citizens trust no one but MAGA and whatever Trump says is *de facto* the truth. Just go down the list of every major American institution that MAGA has tried to undermine: the Pentagon, the Intelligence Community, both major political parties, corporate America, public and higher education, libraries, journalism, the scientific community, etc. Doctors and public health are one more group who have to be torn down because some people might believe them if they contradict the Administration.

I'm sure that many people will rationalize away the harm, just as they did when MAGA undermined trust in the COVID vaccine. They will say it's exaggerated or made up by the media. They will say that the harm from vaccines was worse and covered up. Etc.","14_3"

We were in your 8 of (if I recall correctly) 14 hours of observation based on the medicine he was given.  A kid came in with suspected measles and I heard the doctors talking, and then PPE was being put on.  I called my doctor over and said I was uncomfortable and wanted to leave.  He convinced me to stay.  

An hour or so later, another kid walks by our room and makes eye contact with my son, she smiles and waves.  The doctors usher her to another isolation room and again, PPE goes on and everyone does their thing.  My doctor came over, asked if I saw it all and asked if I was okay.   I just said were leaving and put our jackets on and left.  Doctor said that was a good idea and time to go.  

My son was double vaccinated for measles at the time but his brother was less than one.  We did not want to bring that home.  We even waited a little time for the air to filter and have a lower chance of infection from when the girl walked passed our door.  Apparently with measles, the risk of infection from being in the same room / airspace is something crazy high (again, it was a long time ago, if I recall correctly its like 80%+).

Their grift actually relied on trying to keep vaccination rates at only the bare minimum needed for herd immunity but not a person more - that way the public health wouldnt be endangered, but they could bilk the people who would listen to them.

And it worked for years and years. They made millions off their bullshit antivax campaigns and in general the stray outbreak was mild and contained to small populations and they could find some way to rationalize their way out of culpability.

The second thing is that while assholes like RFK actually do get the science, they dont have the slightest inkling when it comes to the _necessary_ bureaucracy implied by a vaccination program covering 350 million people. They dont understand how much of such a program comes down to paperwork and logistics and checking and rechecking and rerechecking things.

That's also untrue. You cannot just call people corporate suits because they are women or minorities.

Just who is the most progressive elected president? Sure Clinton and Kamala would fit that category but they lost.

Instead of term limits we need to:

1. Educate the populace onthe people they vote for

2. Have a working media that doesnt promote corporate interests.

What screwed congress was before the 1970s congressional voting was secret.  You didnt know who voted for what. Members could take special interest money and still vote against them.  Of course lobbyists pushed against this and a law was passed so that all congressional votes are open and published. It seems counterintuitive to say open voting is bad it has led to representatives having to vote against what they think is right and instead for corporate and donator interests.  100% trump would have been impeached in a secret ballot.

As for minimum age for presidency, 

Madison also discussed some points that some scholars believe led to the age requirements: a distrust of foreign influence and a fear of families trying to put children in place in federal office to serve in a hereditary manner. He feared the indiscriminate and hasty admission of people to Congress that might create a channel for foreign influence on the national councils.

Also life expectancy at the time was an influencr, 

James Monroe also wrote about the presidential age requirement making it difficult for a father and son to serve in a dynastic way. The Constitution has provided, that no person shall be eligible to the office, who is not thirty five years old; and in the course of nature very few fathers leave a son who has arrived to that age, he said in A Native of Virginia, Observations upon the Proposed Plan of Federal Government.


Edit; based on the downvotes people here disagree with the founding fathers Madison and Monroe.

Most mayors are not term limited because they do not possess outsize authority to abuse compared to a governor or president whom retain significant authority over military units and police forces. 

We have term limits for legislators to capture the legislatures by outside parties. Having worked in a legislature myself, I can assure you that term limits creates a permanent amateurs class of legislators who dont know how to effectively legislate. With the election cycle and budget cycle, it usually takes a couple years for a legislator to really get their feet wet, if they are even trying (which most dont), at which time they become term limited. 

When we have legislative term limits there becomes a dearth of institutional knowledge among the electeds, instead being stored in legislative staff (whom are usually 22-26 years olds because it is a grueling underpaid and overworked job), political consultants, and lobbyists. Essentially, institutional knowledge and expertise is lost, subject matter expertise is lost, few legislators have enough experience to effectively whip and marshall votes much less to actually lead the legislature. It in effect becomes almost entirely beholden to lobbyists and political consultants and a very small cadre of actually competent legislators. 

If I had a nickel for every time legislation was stymied because an ignorant committee chair was miseducated on a subject by a lobbyist, I could fund my own presidential campaign. 

I do not think term limits are the answer lest they are very generous- like ~~20-30~~ 10-15 year term limits.

*Personally, I think being able to recall members of congress (among all other office holders), would be a better check on our elected officials by the people than term limits.*

In my experience, term limits creates a passive electorate for whom they believe somehow term limits decrease corruption when in reality it creates a permanent amateur legislative body that is much more prone to corruption and manipulation.","3_1_4_1"

Snippet:

&gt;To earn the vote he needed to become the nations top health official, [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://apnews.com/hub/robert-f-kennedy-jr) made a special [promise](https://apnews.com/article/cassidy-kennedy-trump-health-secretary-e826bc40fddf90829f6438681c5d9275) to a U.S. senator: He would not change the nations current vaccination schedule.

&gt;But on Tuesday, speaking for the first time to thousands of U.S. Health and Human Services agency employees, he vowed to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule that prevents measles, polio and other dangerous diseases.

&gt;Nothing is going to be off limits, Kennedy said, adding that pesticides, food additives, microplastics, antidepressants and the electromagnetic waves emitted by cellphones and microwaves also would be studied.

&gt;Kennedys remarks, which circulated on social media, were delivered during a welcome ceremony for the new health secretary at the agencys headquarters in Washington as [a measles outbreak](https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-new-mexico-mmr-outbreak-vaccines-408371700e3ab548777bf0354e586549) among mostly unvaccinated people raged in West Texas. The event was held after a weekend of mass firings of [thousands of HHS employees](https://apnews.com/article/trump-job-cuts-health-cdc-0d002fd6f528a7b91ced79628bf68196). More dismissals are expected.

&gt;In his comments Tuesday, Kennedy promised that a new Make America Healthy Again commission would investigate vaccines, pesticides and antidepressants to see if they have contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses such as [diabetes](https://apnews.com/article/eli-lilly-fourth-quarter-mounjaro-zepbound-ca026922525a9e3abb1b75d329628bef) and [obesity](https://apnews.com/article/how-common-is-obesity-us-5663c0388b19009eae3834d695710bc4) that have plagued the American public. The commission was formed last week in an executive order by [Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/article/pence-2025-interview-trump-lobbying-agenda-relationship-c035c2d4a235ec685eb5e8bfb4170f7b) immediately after [Kennedy](https://apnews.com/article/rfk-trump-health-secretary-vote-5dbefeef0537dc241e6fb33b8f2a748b) was sworn in as the presidents new health secretary.","7"

There is no radical left in the way that they describe. Republicans declared war on mainstream Democratic principals of treating everybody equivalently and with decency.

All such research is now under direct scrutiny from health secretary and long-time anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

A senior official at the NIH's National Cancer Institute confirmed to KFF that NIH acting Director Matthew Memoli ""sent an email across the NIH instructing that any grants, contracts, or collaborations involving mRNA vaccines be reported up the chain to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.s office and the White House.""""

ETA:  Whoa.  And this---""While it remains unclear if mRNA vaccine research funding will be canceled or limited, researchers fear the worst. Last week, news broke that the NIH was canceling or limiting grant funding for [research related to vaccine hesitancy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/10/vaccines-nih-rfk-research-canceled/)which has increased significantly in recent years, leading to declining vaccination rates and the loss of herd immunity in many communities.""

Language for grant termination notices stated: ""It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focuses gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment,"" according to reporting from The Washington Post.

Those terminations were preceded by an email from Memoli similar to the one he sent regarding mRNA vaccines, KFF reported. ""It is reasonable to assume mRNA vaccine work is next,"" the NCI official told the outlet.

And this was reported earlier but bears  repeating:

""The NIH's recent moves aren't the first sign that Kennedy will use his powerful position to attack mRNA vaccines. Late last month, Bloomberg reported that HHS was considering canceling a [$590 million grant to vaccine maker Moderna](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Announces-Updates-on-Pandemic-Influenza-Program/default.aspx) to develop [mRNA vaccines against potential pandemic influenza](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/trump-team-weighs-pulling-funding-for-moderna-bird-flu-vaccine) viruses. That includes the H5N1 virus that is currently devastating US poultry and spreading wildly in dairy cows.""

The review is part of a government push to examine spending on messenger RNA-based vaccines, the technology that powered Modernas Covid vaccine. The bird flu shot contract was awarded to Moderna in the Biden administrations final days, sending the companys stock up 13% in the two days following the Jan. 17 announcement.

The US is in the midst of a record-breaking bird flu outbreak thats affected dozens of cattle herds along with poultry flocks nationwide, sending egg prices soaring. While human cases have been relatively rare, the virus has caused deaths in the past, and experts are concerned that it could become more transmissible and dangerous.

Moderna said in January it was gearing up for a big final-stage trial of its vaccine, after successfully completing an early-stage trial last year. Without funding, that big trial may not happen.

Back then he headed an anti-vaccine non profit called ""The Children's Health Defense"" organization, which, in a disturbingly ironic sort of way, contributed to the deaths of dozens of children...

But first,

RFK Jr has made it clear that his goals as health secretary, in exchange for loyalty to Trump of course, will be to acknowledge discredited health ""experts"" and conspiracy theories, reinforce distrust in the professional medical community, undermine scientific research and jeopardize public health by subscribing to a MAGA agenda that intends to erode the independence of government agencies, especially health agencies like the CDC, FDA, the NIH, etc...

RFK Jr. is a disastrous pick for this position in the sense that he's capable of doing serious damage to public health.

And this is made all the more evident by his involvement in the measles outbreak in Samoa that claimed the lives of some 83 people.

Before I get into it, make sure to tune into *Behind the Bastards* recent four-part series that examines RFK Jr.'s life and career.

It's an eye opening look at the guy's lifelong privilege, and his pattern of bizarre, abusive, perverse and hypocritical behavior.

That being said, In 2019, there was a measles outbreak in Samoa that led to the deaths of 83 people, mostly children. What did Kennedy have to do with this? Well, of course he denies any involvement, but he visited the island a few months prior to the outbreak, and at the time, he led the Children's Health Defense organization, an anti-vax non profit.

His non profit helped spread misinformation pertaining to vaccines that contributed to a decline in measles vaccinations. During his trip to Samoa, he publicly supported prominent anti-vax voices there and by exploiting the power of his last name, lent legitimacy to those voices who were very effective at stoking vaccine hesitancy.

Now, prior to 2019, measles wasn't a problem in Samoa, however, in 2018, two infants died after receiving the measles vaccine. The country temporarily placed its vaccination program on hold, and Kennedy's Children's Health Defense took advantage of the tragedy to raise questions about the safety of the measles vaccine. Consequently the vaccination rate plummeted.

As it turns out however, the deaths of the infants had nothing to do with the measles vaccine, and everything to do with tragic human error. Nurses administering the vaccine accidentally mixed it with a muscle relaxant, which is what killed the infants.

Kennedy and his non profit did not walk back their statements afterwards, particularly as vaccination rates were dropping rapidly in the region.

When he visited the island in 2019before the outbreakhe promoted anti-vaxxers and anti-vax rhetoric. He especially lent credibility to voices there that were still using the deaths of the infants to push a narrative.

&gt; He had a meeting with Taylor Winterstein, a prominent Samoan Australian vaccination foe. In an Instagram post featuring a photo of her with Kennedy, Winterstein wrote, I am deeply honoured to have been in the presence of a man I believe is, can and will change the course of history. This was a divinely timed, once in a lifetime opportunity and I will forever cherish the conversations and moments we shared together in Samoa. She added hashtags used by anti-vaxxers. Public health experts complained Kennedys visit to Samoa helped amplifly anti-vax voices.

Kennedy claimed that his meeting with Winterstein was just a coincidence, not ""divinely timed."" He eventually admitted however, that his trip to Samoa had been arranged with a popular anti-vaxxer, Edwin Tamasese. The trip was paid for by the CHD.

&gt; The point of the trip, he insisted, was to discuss with government officials the introduction of a medical informatics system that would allow Samoas health officials to assess, in real time, the efficacy and safety of every medical intervention or drug on overall health. This would include questioning the value of vaccinations.

After the measles outbreak in 2019, the government quickly implemented an emergency vaccination program that was compulsory for the population. Kennedy's anti-vax connections on the island vehemently opposed this measure. The operation was compared to Nazi Germany.

&gt; Tamasese called it a killing spree. He declared the vaccination operation the greatest crime against our people and suggested the vaccine itself was the cause of the outbreak. Tamasese advocated against the use of conventional medicine and antibiotics and urged people to rely on papaya leaf extract and vitamins instead of the vaccine and antibiotics.

During this time, Kennedy wrote to the prime Minister, *and he encouraged Samoa officials to examine the measles vaccine to 'determine, scientifically, if the outbreak was caused by inadequate vaccine coverage or alternatively, by a defective vaccine.'*

Kennedy and these anti-vax voices were pushing the idea that the vaccine itself was responsible for the deaths during the outbreak.

The Samoan government declared a state of emergency, and pushed back against prominent anti-vaxxers.

&gt; Soon after that, Kennedy wrote a blog post for the CHD site that called Tamasese a medical freedom hero. He referred to the 2019 blast of measles in Samoa as merely a mild measles outbreak and praised Tamasese for having infuriated the Global Medical Cartel. He suggested that the vaccine, along with lousy hospital protocols, had caused the deaths. 

So yah, he's a piece of shit. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. 

While to this day, he continues to deny his involvement and his responsibility in the Samoa tragedy.

Again, this is the guy that Trump has made secretary of health. Let that sink in. Imagine this scenario I've laid out for you, but on a national scale.

And keep in mind, as it currently stands, there are over 200 reported cases of measles in the US as part of an outbreak that's spread over 12 states, with a majority of the cases in Texas. One of the deaths from this outbreak includes an *unvaccinated* adult from New Mexico.

In a better world, this incident would have disqualified RFK Jr. from working in any government position, let alone director of HHS. 

Trump and his allies have already initiated a plan to first cripple the independence of most government agencies, purge these agencies of anyone who is not loyal to the MAGA agenda, then put them under the direct control of the president and an executive with unilateral powers and broad immunities.

By doing this, they can install loyalists into positions of power once reserved for non-partisan civil servants and educated experts in their respective fields, leading to a crisis of incompetence at every level of government responsible for preserving public health. They've also set their sights on the FDA, the CDC, the EPA, the USDA, all public health related agencies, and may even take steps to eliminate them altogether. Combine this with the fact that the Republican party is currently lauding Trump's efforts to slash funding for scientific research, and you've a recipe for a public health crisis.","2"

But I want our vaccines to be as safe as possible.

The spin/slander is crazy to me. His core belief is that our governmental systems/policies are corrupted by corporations. Safety thresholds are skewed to maintain profits at the expense of safety. Hes an idiot about a lot of stuff, but his distrust in our corrupt government is warranted imo.

but also due to his utter capitulation to Trump and a MAGA agenda that is eroding the independence of public health related agencies, stripping knowledgeable civil servants of their protections within these agencies, and taking steps to dismantle agencies and organizations that are largely responsible for day-to-day operations and broader objectives related to the safety of Americans, the preservation and protection of the environment, and the overall maintaining of public health. 

And are you really suggesting that your outdated examples not only negate his long list of both more frequent and more recent ignorant and dangerously unscientific remarks, but also absolve him of responsibility in this crisis that took the lives of dozens of children!? No... 

Here are some more recent examples.

&gt; Kennedy: 'I probably did say, Lyme disease is ""highly likely a militarily engineered bioweapon""'

&gt; Kennedy has repeatedly suggested environmental toxins, including those in drinking water, are linked to gender identity in children. These claims are unfounded.

&gt; In particular, he has reiterated a thoroughly debunked theory that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism

&gt; Kennedy has also referred to the Covid vaccine as the deadliest vaccine ever made, despite data showing its overwhelmingly safe.

&gt; At an event last year, Kennedy promoted a racist and antisemitic theory that Covid ethnically targeted white and Black people but not Ashkenazi Jews or Chinese people.

&gt; Kennedy has amplified baseless claims suggesting a link between antidepressants like Prozac and school shootings. Prior to the introduction of Prozac, we had almost none of these events, he told billionaire Elon Musk last year. But research shows that most school shooters were not previously treated with psychotropic medications  and even when they were, there was no association between those drugs and the shootings.

&gt; He has long peddled AIDS denialism conspiracy theories, alleging that HIV does not cause AIDS and questioning the theology that HIV is the sole cause of AIDS.

&gt; He lamented that any questioning of the orthodoxy that HIV is the sole cause of AIDS remains an unforgivable  even dangerous  heresy among our reigning medical cartel and its media allies 

&gt; Kennedys book frequently cites discredited work of Peter Duesberg, a prominent AIDS denialist. I havent found any evidence that HIV ever actually kills a T-cell.

&gt; He argued vaccines make people lose IQ and said the vaccine dominant narrative has little proof.

&gt; Kennedy claimed vaccinologists add toxins to vaccines to amplify immune response. They literally went on a search throughout the world looking for the most toxic things that they could find in order to add them to the vaccine,

&gt; Kennedy claimed that nobody knows the risk for any currently scheduled vaccines and that nobody can say with any scientific certainty that [the polio] vaccine is averting more injuries than death than its causing.

&gt; claimed flu and polio vaccines increase susceptibility to future flu strains and polio cases.

&gt; Kennedy has claimed that ""there is zero evidence that the flu shot prevents any hospitalization or any deaths... The flu shot transmits the flu. In fact, if you get the flu shot, you're six times more likely to give somebody else the flu, than if you didn't get the flu shot.""

&gt; Since we started mandating the flu shot for elderly people... Their life expectancy has dramatically gone down.

&gt; speaking on Health Freedom for Humanity, a podcast run by a nonprofit advocating for medical freedom, Kennedy encouraged people to join him in telling strangers not to vaccinate their babies

&gt; In July 2023, the same month he testified at the House hearing, Kennedy said in a podcast interview that theres no vaccine that is safe and effective.

&gt; He also accused Fauci of destroying repurposed medications like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin that also wouldve obliterated Covid.

I could hit reddit's character limit many times over with these types of examples. Are you honestly suggesting that this man is fit for the position he currently holds?","2_2_1"

Im guessing you'd probably clutch your pearls at Democrats in Congress for not applauding Trump while he paraded around a child with cancer during the joint session, using the kid as a political prop, and all while the Trump admin is taking actions to cut funding for scientific research, including cancer research, with no objection from RFK Jr mind you, the man who you trust to oversee public health.

But dozens of children die due to the negligence and ignorance of a bunch of vaccine skeptics, while RFK Jr. exploited his wealth, his influence and privilege to get politically involved, browbeat public officials, encourage vaccine hesitancy, prop up anti-vax voices, and sow distrust in vaccines, helping to contribute to the deaths of these children, and he's your hero?

While we do have a mostly privatized healthcare system, it is still very hard to enter the healthcare market because you have to rigorously prove your product is safe and does what you claim it does. Thats the whole point of the FDA, or at-least when it comes to the drug part. 

This is obviously very frustrating for the traditional and alt-medicine community which wants to claim it possesses curative effects for just about everything.

Some drug manufactures essentially posses a monopoly on the prescribed treatments for certain illnesses. This can be a real issue like when they jack up prices for a medication that people need to survive. But RFK isnt coming at this from a we need to protect consumers from price gouging on life saving medicine point of view. Its more of a vulture looking at how much fucking money could be made if government certified drug manufacturers are no longer the only players in the health and psychiatric care game.

Are you worried about your kid getting measles? That they might be depressed? Well good news, all sorts of companies are going to be claiming they can prevent it. The difference is the burden of determining what actually works is going to be on the consumer, not a regulatory body.","2_2"

An FDA vaccine advisory committee meeting that was set to discuss what flu strains to include in next season's flu vaccine has been canceled.

&gt;A Food and Drug Administration vaccine advisory committee meeting that was set to discuss what flu strains to include in next season's flu vaccine has been canceled, multiple sources told ABC News, leaving some to wonder if the meeting cancelation will delay next year's flu vaccine delivery schedule.

&gt;The high-profile, public meetings of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee are where independent experts review scientific data and vote on a variety of vaccine related issues. Members of the March 13 meeting were set to vote on which flu strains would offer the most protection in next season's flu shot.

&gt;""Influenza vaccines aren't perfect and to get the best influence vaccine each year requires predicting the strain as best we can,"" said Dr. Andrew Pavia, professor of pediatrics and medicine at the University of Utah and a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. ""There's a lot of complex data that needs to be reviewed and having a number of experts do it gives us the best chance of making the best prediction.""

&gt;The meeting typically takes into consideration recommendations from WHO. It also receives input and data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Defense and vaccine manufacturers.

&gt;The timing of this meeting aligns with the six-month lead time typically required for vaccine manufacturing to ensure vaccines are ready for distribution in the fall -- before peak flu season hits in the United States.

&gt;""I can't think of any rational reason to do this other than to throw a hand grenade into vaccine production,"" Pavia said. ""The impact is going to be felt in terms of our ability to reduce flu hospitalizations and flu deaths.""","6"

But COVID *really* turned vaccine skepticism into a partisan issue. Dems were in favor of vaccines, masking, and other preventive measures, which meant Republicans HAD to take the complete opposite approach to managing the Pandemic. This reactionary attitude seems to have spilled over onto their opinions regarding ALL vaccines and many other medical procedures.

And

""Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons.""

The major claims are criminally exaggerated,

basically you are 2000 times more likely to die in a car wreck than get any protection from penile cancer from circumcision. The serious complication risks from the surgery are higher than the penile cancer risk. Yes its a 50% reduction, but from 1/100,000 to 0.5/100,000 chance

 It would take cutting 111+ boys to prevent a single UTI.

The cleanliness is also trivial, it takes two seconds to add a rinse of it when showering.

the most extensive circumcision/ std study (810,000+ males over 36 years of medical history) ever found that circumcision actually increased std risk

The dye had not been banned prior to this because the experts in the FDA understood that the study cited does not measure the risk factor of acceptable use, but was instead a study to measure a catastrophically high amount's effects.

However, because of a decision made by the supreme Court last June, the experts that are in place among the regulatory bodies are no longer permitted to use their expertise in how to implement laws (known as the Chevron deference) and instead must follow the law as written, regardless if the lawmakers didn't understand the technical details.  https://earthjustice.org/press/2024/supreme-court-eliminates-longstanding-legal-principle-concerning-federal-regulation

Why is this relevant?  Now a group can fund a ""research"" project that is designed to return a result that they want, even if it isn't fully relevant, and then use that to force policy changes.  If they inject a rat with 46000 doses of the MMR vaccine every day I'd wager that they can find a negative side effect that they can use to have them banned.","3_3"

[Lancet MMR autism fraud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancet_MMR_autism_fraud)

&gt;On 28 February 1998, a fraudulent research paper by physician Andrew Wakefield and twelve coauthors, titled ""Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children"", was published in the British medical journal The Lancet.[1] The paper falsely claimed causative links between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and colitis and between colitis and autism. The fraud involved data selection, data manipulation, and two undisclosed conflicts of interest. It was exposed in a lengthy Sunday Times investigation[2][3][4][5] by reporter Brian Deer,[6][7][8] resulting in the paper's retraction in February 2010[9] and Wakefield being discredited and struck off the UK medical register three months later. Wakefield reportedly stood to earn up to US$43 million per year selling diagnostic kits for a non-existent syndrome he claimed to have discovered.[10] He also held a patent to a rival vaccine at the time, and he had been employed by a lawyer representing parents in lawsuits against vaccine producers.

&gt;The scientific consensus on vaccines and autism is that there is no causal connection between MMR, or any other vaccine, and autism.

How much can I now collect to have prevented this massive waste?","5"

On Dec 17th, three days after the rollout of mass vaccinations, he told everyone to get one (via tweet).  It's not like he discouraged the use of an available vaccine until too late--it didn't exist.  I would say that one good thing Trump did was encourage people to get the covid vaccine, but it's because he wanted credit for its creation, not because of any belief in, ya know, medicine.","2_1_1_1_1_1_3"

By that time vaccinations were widely used in other countries, it was his administration who dragged their feet, while fear mongering about it the whole time.

The fact that at the end of his term decided to change his ton and semi support the vaccine doesn't put him in the good books, it was purely political, people died all so he could get a pat on the back.

Don't get me wrong, I'm glad everybody is getting their shot, but we could have all done without the dramatic preamble, the echos of which are still alive and well today.

I can think of at least two broad ways that this advances the MAGA agenda. Not the stated agenda but the actual agenda.

1. Revenge. Trump in particular and MAGA in general have shown a strong preference for attacking anything and everything associated with people/groups who have stood up to them. Trump and MAGA feel that the medical establishment turned on them during COVID and cuts at CDC, NIH, etc. along with anti-vax measures are designed to outrage them.

2. Institutional destabilization. The MAGA movement wants to be the sole source of truth and power in the country. Every institution with independent expertise and values must be undermined and degraded so that the citizens trust no one but MAGA and whatever Trump says is *de facto* the truth. Just go down the list of every major American institution that MAGA has tried to undermine: the Pentagon, the Intelligence Community, both major political parties, corporate America, public and higher education, libraries, journalism, the scientific community, etc. Doctors and public health are one more group who have to be torn down because some people might believe them if they contradict the Administration.

I'm sure that many people will rationalize away the harm, just as they did when MAGA undermined trust in the COVID vaccine. They will say it's exaggerated or made up by the media. They will say that the harm from vaccines was worse and covered up. Etc.","14_3"

There are politicians there that have ties to these crazy ideologies and their top people.  They were talking about how vaccines are dangerous and parents should not be able to force them on kids.  I literally mentioned that all of us were vaccinated for these things and none of us were messed up (I guess we could argue this one in some ways) and that no vaccinations would mean a lot of deaths.

Now, you might guess their response.  But here it is.

  
They told me that it is survival of the fittest.  That getting these diseases will kill some but that is because they are weak.  And that the strong will survive.  They never mention that they have the money for the best health care.  Trump had COVID and was visibly struggling.  Good healthcare can help outcomes.  Seen poor people die from things someone with money would have beaten.  They just did not have money to pay for all the expensive treatments.  Or at least not soon enough.

  
They do not want to hear that though.  They use the excuse that it is not their responsibility for people that cannot succeed.  But plenty of people design and make good ideas.  But the way it is they can be working for a company and never get their credit.  Goes to the CEO and others.  People working their ass off to make money for the few at the top get shit on.","4"

I don't even think I've ever had to even pay for a flu shot, but I don't know if that's just due to my particular state. Because it's a public health issue I think normally government is keen to vaccinate anyone they can for flu.

I have no actual idea what the process is in Canada or Mexico, but I can't imagine there's many hurdles to routine flu shots since the goal is to vaccinate as many as possible.

Though if a whole bunch of Americans were coming into Canadian or Mexican pharmacies to get shots, which seems likely if there was a problem in the US, then I'd expect there would be some kind of issue if it was depleting vaccines allocated to local areas which could potentially create shortages for actual citizens.","11_1_1"

Snippet:

&gt;To earn the vote he needed to become the nations top health official, [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://apnews.com/hub/robert-f-kennedy-jr) made a special [promise](https://apnews.com/article/cassidy-kennedy-trump-health-secretary-e826bc40fddf90829f6438681c5d9275) to a U.S. senator: He would not change the nations current vaccination schedule.

&gt;But on Tuesday, speaking for the first time to thousands of U.S. Health and Human Services agency employees, he vowed to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule that prevents measles, polio and other dangerous diseases.

&gt;Nothing is going to be off limits, Kennedy said, adding that pesticides, food additives, microplastics, antidepressants and the electromagnetic waves emitted by cellphones and microwaves also would be studied.

&gt;Kennedys remarks, which circulated on social media, were delivered during a welcome ceremony for the new health secretary at the agencys headquarters in Washington as [a measles outbreak](https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-new-mexico-mmr-outbreak-vaccines-408371700e3ab548777bf0354e586549) among mostly unvaccinated people raged in West Texas. The event was held after a weekend of mass firings of [thousands of HHS employees](https://apnews.com/article/trump-job-cuts-health-cdc-0d002fd6f528a7b91ced79628bf68196). More dismissals are expected.

&gt;In his comments Tuesday, Kennedy promised that a new Make America Healthy Again commission would investigate vaccines, pesticides and antidepressants to see if they have contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses such as [diabetes](https://apnews.com/article/eli-lilly-fourth-quarter-mounjaro-zepbound-ca026922525a9e3abb1b75d329628bef) and [obesity](https://apnews.com/article/how-common-is-obesity-us-5663c0388b19009eae3834d695710bc4) that have plagued the American public.

Back then he headed an anti-vaccine non profit called ""The Children's Health Defense"" organization, which, in a disturbingly ironic sort of way, contributed to the deaths of dozens of children...

But first,

RFK Jr has made it clear that his goals as health secretary, in exchange for loyalty to Trump of course, will be to acknowledge discredited health ""experts"" and conspiracy theories, reinforce distrust in the professional medical community, undermine scientific research and jeopardize public health by subscribing to a MAGA agenda that intends to erode the independence of government agencies, especially health agencies like the CDC, FDA, the NIH, etc...

RFK Jr. is a disastrous pick for this position in the sense that he's capable of doing serious damage to public health.

And this is made all the more evident by his involvement in the measles outbreak in Samoa that claimed the lives of some 83 people.

Before I get into it, make sure to tune into *Behind the Bastards* recent four-part series that examines RFK Jr.'s life and career.

It's an eye opening look at the guy's lifelong privilege, and his pattern of bizarre, abusive, perverse and hypocritical behavior.

That being said, In 2019, there was a measles outbreak in Samoa that led to the deaths of 83 people, mostly children. What did Kennedy have to do with this? Well, of course he denies any involvement, but he visited the island a few months prior to the outbreak, and at the time, he led the Children's Health Defense organization, an anti-vax non profit.

His non profit helped spread misinformation pertaining to vaccines that contributed to a decline in measles vaccinations. During his trip to Samoa, he publicly supported prominent anti-vax voices there and by exploiting the power of his last name, lent legitimacy to those voices who were very effective at stoking vaccine hesitancy.

Now, prior to 2019, measles wasn't a problem in Samoa, however, in 2018, two infants died after receiving the measles vaccine. The country temporarily placed its vaccination program on hold, and Kennedy's Children's Health Defense took advantage of the tragedy to raise questions about the safety of the measles vaccine. Consequently the vaccination rate plummeted.

As it turns out however, the deaths of the infants had nothing to do with the measles vaccine, and everything to do with tragic human error. Nurses administering the vaccine accidentally mixed it with a muscle relaxant, which is what killed the infants.

Kennedy and his non profit did not walk back their statements afterwards, particularly as vaccination rates were dropping rapidly in the region.

When he visited the island in 2019before the outbreakhe promoted anti-vaxxers and anti-vax rhetoric. He especially lent credibility to voices there that were still using the deaths of the infants to push a narrative.

&gt; He had a meeting with Taylor Winterstein, a prominent Samoan Australian vaccination foe. In an Instagram post featuring a photo of her with Kennedy, Winterstein wrote, I am deeply honoured to have been in the presence of a man I believe is, can and will change the course of history. This was a divinely timed, once in a lifetime opportunity and I will forever cherish the conversations and moments we shared together in Samoa. She added hashtags used by anti-vaxxers. Public health experts complained Kennedys visit to Samoa helped amplifly anti-vax voices.

Kennedy claimed that his meeting with Winterstein was just a coincidence, not ""divinely timed."" He eventually admitted however, that his trip to Samoa had been arranged with a popular anti-vaxxer, Edwin Tamasese. The trip was paid for by the CHD.

&gt; The point of the trip, he insisted, was to discuss with government officials the introduction of a medical informatics system that would allow Samoas health officials to assess, in real time, the efficacy and safety of every medical intervention or drug on overall health. This would include questioning the value of vaccinations.

After the measles outbreak in 2019, the government quickly implemented an emergency vaccination program that was compulsory for the population. Kennedy's anti-vax connections on the island vehemently opposed this measure. The operation was compared to Nazi Germany.

&gt; Tamasese called it a killing spree. He declared the vaccination operation the greatest crime against our people and suggested the vaccine itself was the cause of the outbreak. Tamasese advocated against the use of conventional medicine and antibiotics and urged people to rely on papaya leaf extract and vitamins instead of the vaccine and antibiotics.

During this time, Kennedy wrote to the prime Minister, *and he encouraged Samoa officials to examine the measles vaccine to 'determine, scientifically, if the outbreak was caused by inadequate vaccine coverage or alternatively, by a defective vaccine.'*

Kennedy and these anti-vax voices were pushing the idea that the vaccine itself was responsible for the deaths during the outbreak.

The Samoan government declared a state of emergency, and pushed back against prominent anti-vaxxers.

&gt; Soon after that, Kennedy wrote a blog post for the CHD site that called Tamasese a medical freedom hero. He referred to the 2019 blast of measles in Samoa as merely a mild measles outbreak and praised Tamasese for having infuriated the Global Medical Cartel. He suggested that the vaccine, along with lousy hospital protocols, had caused the deaths. 

So yah, he's a piece of shit. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. 

While to this day, he continues to deny his involvement and his responsibility in the Samoa tragedy.

Again, this is the guy that Trump has made secretary of health. Let that sink in. Imagine this scenario I've laid out for you, but on a national scale.

And keep in mind, as it currently stands, there are over 200 reported cases of measles in the US as part of an outbreak that's spread over 12 states, with a majority of the cases in Texas. One of the deaths from this outbreak includes an *unvaccinated* adult from New Mexico.

In a better world, this incident would have disqualified RFK Jr. from working in any government position, let alone director of HHS. 

Trump and his allies have already initiated a plan to first cripple the independence of most government agencies, purge these agencies of anyone who is not loyal to the MAGA agenda, then put them under the direct control of the president and an executive with unilateral powers and broad immunities.

By doing this, they can install loyalists into positions of power once reserved for non-partisan civil servants and educated experts in their respective fields, leading to a crisis of incompetence at every level of government responsible for preserving public health. They've also set their sights on the FDA, the CDC, the EPA, the USDA, all public health related agencies, and may even take steps to eliminate them altogether. Combine this with the fact that the Republican party is currently lauding Trump's efforts to slash funding for scientific research, and you've a recipe for a public health crisis.","2"

No doubt. It already looks like he's not going to coordinate having a flu vaccine available for next year. And canceling funding for research into a bird flu vaccine. 

Imagine if bird flu epidemic hit the US population next winter at the same time we don't have any flu protection? Could be absolutely devastating and make COVID look like a picnic.","2_1"

But I want our vaccines to be as safe as possible.

The spin/slander is crazy to me. His core belief is that our governmental systems/policies are corrupted by corporations. Safety thresholds are skewed to maintain profits at the expense of safety. Hes an idiot about a lot of stuff, but his distrust in our corrupt government is warranted imo. 

Here are 10 legal cases won by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. with brief descriptions:

but also due to his utter capitulation to Trump and a MAGA agenda that is eroding the independence of public health related agencies, stripping knowledgeable civil servants of their protections within these agencies, and taking steps to dismantle agencies and organizations that are largely responsible for day-to-day operations and broader objectives related to the safety of Americans, the preservation and protection of the environment, and the overall maintaining of public health. 

And are you really suggesting that your outdated examples not only negate his long list of both more frequent and more recent ignorant and dangerously unscientific remarks, but also absolve him of responsibility in this crisis that took the lives of dozens of children!? No... 

Here are some more recent examples.

&gt; Kennedy: 'I probably did say, Lyme disease is ""highly likely a militarily engineered bioweapon""'

&gt; Kennedy has repeatedly suggested environmental toxins, including those in drinking water, are linked to gender identity in children. These claims are unfounded.

&gt; In particular, he has reiterated a thoroughly debunked theory that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism

&gt; Kennedy has also referred to the Covid vaccine as the deadliest vaccine ever made, despite data showing its overwhelmingly safe.

&gt; At an event last year, Kennedy promoted a racist and antisemitic theory that Covid ethnically targeted white and Black people but not Ashkenazi Jews or Chinese people.

&gt; Kennedy has amplified baseless claims suggesting a link between antidepressants like Prozac and school shootings. Prior to the introduction of Prozac, we had almost none of these events, he told billionaire Elon Musk last year. But research shows that most school shooters were not previously treated with psychotropic medications  and even when they were, there was no association between those drugs and the shootings.

&gt; He has long peddled AIDS denialism conspiracy theories, alleging that HIV does not cause AIDS and questioning the theology that HIV is the sole cause of AIDS.

&gt; He lamented that any questioning of the orthodoxy that HIV is the sole cause of AIDS remains an unforgivable  even dangerous  heresy among our reigning medical cartel and its media allies 

&gt; Kennedys book frequently cites discredited work of Peter Duesberg, a prominent AIDS denialist. I havent found any evidence that HIV ever actually kills a T-cell.

&gt; He argued vaccines make people lose IQ and said the vaccine dominant narrative has little proof.

&gt; Kennedy claimed vaccinologists add toxins to vaccines to amplify immune response. They literally went on a search throughout the world looking for the most toxic things that they could find in order to add them to the vaccine,

&gt; Kennedy claimed that nobody knows the risk for any currently scheduled vaccines and that nobody can say with any scientific certainty that [the polio] vaccine is averting more injuries than death than its causing.

&gt; claimed flu and polio vaccines increase susceptibility to future flu strains and polio cases.

&gt; Kennedy has claimed that ""there is zero evidence that the flu shot prevents any hospitalization or any deaths... The flu shot transmits the flu. In fact, if you get the flu shot, you're six times more likely to give somebody else the flu, than if you didn't get the flu shot.""

&gt; Since we started mandating the flu shot for elderly people... Their life expectancy has dramatically gone down.

&gt; speaking on Health Freedom for Humanity, a podcast run by a nonprofit advocating for medical freedom, Kennedy encouraged people to join him in telling strangers not to vaccinate their babies

&gt; In July 2023, the same month he testified at the House hearing, Kennedy said in a podcast interview that theres no vaccine that is safe and effective.

&gt; He also accused Fauci of destroying repurposed medications like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin that also wouldve obliterated Covid.

I could hit reddit's character limit many times over with these types of examples. Are you honestly suggesting that this man is fit for the position he currently holds?","2_2_1"

Im guessing you'd probably clutch your pearls at Democrats in Congress for not applauding Trump while he paraded around a child with cancer during the joint session, using the kid as a political prop, and all while the Trump admin is taking actions to cut funding for scientific research, including cancer research, with no objection from RFK Jr mind you, the man who you trust to oversee public health.

But dozens of children die due to the negligence and ignorance of a bunch of vaccine skeptics, while RFK Jr. exploited his wealth, his influence and privilege to get politically involved, browbeat public officials, encourage vaccine hesitancy, prop up anti-vax voices, and sow distrust in vaccines, helping to contribute to the deaths of these children, and he's your hero?

Yah, you don't care about this tragedy, the lives lost, nor RFK Jr's involvement. You don't care about the facts.

Its more of a vulture looking at how much fucking money could be made if government certified drug manufacturers are no longer the only players in the health and psychiatric care game.

Are you worried about your kid getting measles? That they might be depressed? Well good news, all sorts of companies are going to be claiming they can prevent it. The difference is the burden of determining what actually works is going to be on the consumer, not a regulatory body.","2_2"

The major claims are criminally exaggerated,

basically you are 2000 times more likely to die in a car wreck than get any protection from penile cancer from circumcision. The serious complication risks from the surgery are higher than the penile cancer risk. Yes its a 50% reduction, but from 1/100,000 to 0.5/100,000 chance

 It would take cutting 111+ boys to prevent a single UTI.

The cleanliness is also trivial, it takes two seconds to add a rinse of it when showering.

the most extensive circumcision/ std study (810,000+ males over 36 years of medical history) ever found that circumcision actually increased std risk

That's also untrue. You cannot just call people corporate suits because they are women or minorities.

Just who is the most progressive elected president? Sure Clinton and Kamala would fit that category but they lost.

It denies me my right to vote for someone i think may be best qualified. 

Instead of term limits we need to:

1. Educate the populace onthe people they vote for

2. Have a working media that doesnt promote corporate interests.

What screwed congress was before the 1970s congressional voting was secret.  You didnt know who voted for what. Members could take special interest money and still vote against them.  Of course lobbyists pushed against this and a law was passed so that all congressional votes are open and published. It seems counterintuitive to say open voting is bad it has led to representatives having to vote against what they think is right and instead for corporate and donator interests.  100% trump would have been impeached in a secret ballot.

As for minimum age for presidency, 

Madison also discussed some points that some scholars believe led to the age requirements: a distrust of foreign influence and a fear of families trying to put children in place in federal office to serve in a hereditary manner. He feared the indiscriminate and hasty admission of people to Congress that might create a channel for foreign influence on the national councils.

Also life expectancy at the time was an influencr, 

James Monroe also wrote about the presidential age requirement making it difficult for a father and son to serve in a dynastic way. The Constitution has provided, that no person shall be eligible to the office, who is not thirty five years old; and in the course of nature very few fathers leave a son who has arrived to that age, he said in A Native of Virginia, Observations upon the Proposed Plan of Federal Government.


Edit; based on the downvotes people here disagree with the founding fathers Madison and Monroe.

Most mayors are not term limited because they do not possess outsize authority to abuse compared to a governor or president whom retain significant authority over military units and police forces. 

We have term limits for legislators to capture the legislatures by outside parties. Having worked in a legislature myself, I can assure you that term limits creates a permanent amateurs class of legislators who dont know how to effectively legislate. With the election cycle and budget cycle, it usually takes a couple years for a legislator to really get their feet wet, if they are even trying (which most dont), at which time they become term limited. 

When we have legislative term limits there becomes a dearth of institutional knowledge among the electeds, instead being stored in legislative staff (whom are usually 22-26 years olds because it is a grueling underpaid and overworked job), political consultants, and lobbyists. Essentially, institutional knowledge and expertise is lost, subject matter expertise is lost, few legislators have enough experience to effectively whip and marshall votes much less to actually lead the legislature. It in effect becomes almost entirely beholden to lobbyists and political consultants and a very small cadre of actually competent legislators. 

If I had a nickel for every time legislation was stymied because an ignorant committee chair was miseducated on a subject by a lobbyist, I could fund my own presidential campaign. 

I do not think term limits are the answer lest they are very generous- like ~~20-30~~ 10-15 year term limits.

*Personally, I think being able to recall members of congress (among all other office holders), would be a better check on our elected officials by the people than term limits.*

In my experience, term limits creates a passive electorate for whom they believe somehow term limits decrease corruption when in reality it creates a permanent amateur legislative body that is much more prone to corruption and manipulation.","3_1_4_1"

they are still a risk for the illness while the vaccine works into the system- not due to any shedding of any kind.

While we do have a mostly privatized healthcare system, it is still very hard to enter the healthcare market because you have to rigorously prove your product is safe and does what you claim it does. Thats the whole point of the FDA, or at-least when it comes to the drug part. 

This is obviously very frustrating for the traditional and alt-medicine community which wants to claim it possesses curative effects for just about everything.

Some drug manufactures essentially posses a monopoly on the prescribed treatments for certain illnesses. This can be a real issue like when they jack up prices for a medication that people need to survive. But RFK isnt coming at this from a we need to protect consumers from price gouging on life saving medicine point of view. Its more of a vulture looking at how much fucking money could be made if government certified drug manufacturers are no longer the only players in the health and psychiatric care game.

Are you worried about your kid getting measles? That they might be depressed? Well good news, all sorts of companies are going to be claiming they can prevent it. The difference is the burden of determining what actually works is going to be on the consumer, not a regulatory body.","2_2"
