a fishing ship comes by and offers to save him he replies no god will save and protect me 

a third ship stops and offers to help him but again he refuses saying god will save me 

the man eventually drowns and goes to heaven when he gets to heaven he asks god god i went to church tithed do good deeds why didnt you save me in my time of need

when you say cancer vaccines think of it as a drug that activates your immune system to kill cancer curing you of cancer 

so far they all rely on having more traditional forms of treatment as well but the hope is that we can eliminate entire toxic branches of traditional cancer treatment say just colon surgery but no need for folfox chemo treatment later 

breast cancer may be just surgery with this and some hormone blockerstargeted therapy we already removed the heart toxicity of targeted therapy so no more herceptin next gen drugs are so minimally toxic that the risk of damage to your heart is functionally zero add in this and we talking oh you fatigued maybe some risk of blood clots if you taking tamoxifen but everything else bad such as nausea heart kidney even fucking lung damage gone note in clinical trials at moment results may not be as good as stated here as we learn more but can you fucking imagine taking this away from cancer patients

for example the average cancer patient can pay up to $ annually for treatment assuming five year survival rate they spend $ on treatment thats big money on the table for them to just piss away by instead offering a $ single vaccine that immediately nullifies it

we can use a different example lets look at musicmovie streaming services companies used to sell you a cddvd of the albummovie for you to buy for ~$ and listen towatch forever 

the only potential issue is that this is a onetime purchase after that initial purchase you never pay them again if you want to listen to that album or watch that movie now they have streaming services that have you paying ~$ every month to watchlisten to that same media 

its the same general logic why sell something to somebody once when you can alternatively make them pay a subscription for ideally the next few years and make exponentially more

not a perfect example but the comparison holds water they effectively want to sell sick people a subscription to lifehealthiness not a permanent ownership to it its incredibly fucked up and disturbing why sell a vaccine for ~$ when you can charge somebody for er visits for the next couple months at several thousand dollars to treat the illness and make so much more money","6_2_1_1_2_1"

gtlook i am on your side here about how dumb this is but we should also read the full article hell ill even take the full headline

gt bill would ban vaccines in iowa unless manufacturer waives legal immunity

gtwhether you agree or not there is a legit argument that + years into thier widespread use holding them legally accountable is not unreasonable 

gtdont get me wrong i will continue to take my mrna vaccines and look forward to many more hopefully

i feel my response is worth reading

i work in clinical research and there is no way that a pharmaceutical company would open themselves to that amount of risk

vaccines are relatively safe when i say relatively i mean statistically

human beings come in all shapes sizes and tolerances what works for most of the population may  will not work for an unfortunate few

there is a possibility that you can have a previously unknown severe allergic reaction to any number of substances allergens such as certain foods synthetic substances medications or a combination of them

most of the time after exposure to a potential allergen if there isnt a reaction within    minutes it likely means you can tolerate it

sometimes although rarely there can be a delayed allergic reaction   hours later by this time it might be impossible to tell how many other substances the person had been exposed to also people can spontaneously develop new allergies at any time

sure one might take an allergen skin test to help determine which substances they are allergic to however studies have shown that    of positives are false

another way to determine an allergic reaction is to reexposure but there isnt an ethical doctor who would take that responsibility by purposely giving medication that is a suspected severe allergen for that patient

clinical research studies for these vaccines and other medications have already looked for and documented most if not all patterns of allergic reactions in people in short this is done via the physicians known as principal investigators with ethical oversight institutional review boards and pharmacovigalence teams along with active monitoring of the study data clinical research associates in phases   and  with each phase undergoing a safety and efficacy review by the fda before moving onto the next phase 

even after approval permission to market the drug is granted it is under the condition that a longterm postmarketing surveillance study must be done which takes several years or up to decades to complete

this whole process costs between $   billion dollars

bringing this back to legal immunity waivers for vaccines basically the entire investment made for safety and efficacy will be discarded if this bill becomes law since patients can now sue them for any side effects or deaths even after they were informed of the risks based on the results of the completion of the clinical research studies this combined with the fact that even after you leave the place where you received the vaccine its almost impossible to say with certainty that said vaccine is  the cause

patient lawsuits from iowans would not only be a huge additional expense for pharma companies but would also clog up their legal system with cases that would be difficult or impossible to prove

if this bill becomes law in iowa it also might open the floodgates for legal immunity waivers for all other medications since the process of safety and efficacy is done using the same process","29"

andrew wakefields fraudulent study connecting mmr to autism and bowel disorders was published in  wakefield was not originally antivaccination though he advocated for splitting the mmr vaccine into three separate ones and administering them over the course of a year not coincidentally he had applied for a patent on a singledisease measles vaccine a few months before publishing his paper and he was paid for the study by a law firm that had plans to sue the mmr vaccine manufacturer

the cdc had declared the measles eradicated in  because theyd stopped human to human transmission within the country but in the wake of the controversy around wakefields paper vaccine hesitancy for the mmr vaccine flared  there was a resultant measles outbreak in  and there were significant communities in new york north carolina and texas that were experiencing measles outbreaks at the time due to low vaccination rates immunization rates dropped even more in the uk where they were reported as low as  percent in some parts of london down from  percent this vaccine hesistancy started to spread to other vaccines like tdap which ended up contributing to a surge in pertussis diagnoses at the same time

i was getting my degree in public health at the time and remembered talking about it a lot in classes and discussion sections these were primarily ultraconservative religious groups that were opposed to vaccines already but the wakefield paper and the growing controversy made their decisions and beliefs seem more mainstream and palatable this was also around the time that jenny mccarthy started her activism and vaccine hesitancy specifically around the measles began to grow steam outside of those small ultraconservative groups

then there were several outbreaks througout the s primarily imported by migrants or visitors from the phillippines but spread to unvaccinatedbychoice individuals here in the us the most famous of these was a measles outbreak in  at disneyland this happened in pockets leading up to the covid pandemic where the already vaccine skeptical  who had been stewing in online echo chambers and closed communities for  years  introduced the same thinking to covid vaccines the rapid development of the vaccines a modern medical miracle was ironically a contributing factor to the distrust as adults seem to be generally unaware that science advances over time

you could tell the same story about the death of expertise and the rise of uneducated fringe idiots taking prominent positions in us politics  that also seems new but goes back to the tea party i remember when we used to make fun of the tea party in the late searly s because their ideas seemed so extreme and fringe but if you look much of their ideology has been absorbed into the mainstream gop now","14_1"

around  of measles cases develop severe but nonfatal complications most of which are treatable and temporary however about one in  will develop permanent sight hearing or respiratory damage before vaccines measles was the most significant cause of blindness and deafness in societies a similar number will develop a form of encephalitis which frequently results in seizures and  in extreme cases  developmental difficulties a small number less than one in ten thousand will make a full recovery from measles only to die later from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis which is invariably fatal

meanwhile the risks from the vaccine itself are incredibly remote like many vaccinations the side effects are similar to those suffered by those with the disease but at about th the frequency most will suffer no effects a few may develop headaches shortlived rashes and temperatures more severe complications such as anaphylaxis occur at a oneinamillion rate 

despite the debunked claims of a disgraced scientist trying to discredit the mmr vaccine to establish a rival vaccine people still associate vaccines with autism this is entirely incorrect increased instances of autism in societies have been repeatedly associated with andrological changes in men as they age just as if a woman has a child in her s the incidence of trisomy  or downs syndrome increases so the same applies to the age of the father at conception and the frequency of autism moreover the brain states associated with asd can be observed soon after birth and before any vaccination two of the eight children in andrew wakefields debunked survey were already exhibiting asd symptoms before they were vaccinated 

most already know this but if you are one of the cynical who think measles is trivial all of these figures are based on years of data from before vaccination almost stamped out measles and regrettably from data after it came back

 were hospitalized

so  your kid gets measles you have to stay home to care for them but your employer fires you for taking too many days off now youre jobless even if youre in a state where thats technically illegal doge is gutting labor protections so good luck fighting it

and then your kid is one of the ones about a quarter of young kids who needs to be hospitalized because of the measles 

this is where you find out you have no health insurance because you were fired 

oh and thanks to doge its all the more difficult to get processed for unemployment or medicare or snap benefits so now you have no income no food budget you have medical bills you wont be able to pay off which tanks your credit which makes it harder to get a new job without your income you cant pay rent and get evicted and you cant even get a new apartment with the bad credit even when you do finally land another job

best explanation ive seen so far

lets try to simplify what you are really saying for those who arent super familiar with our educational system 

greg abbott we want to offer school choice because the gap between our highest and our lowest achieving students is getting bigger any child can attend a private school if they choose 

family a awesome my child already attends a private school because i am rich and can afford it the voucher now gives me a $ discount on what im already paying 

abbott youre welcome 

family b awesome $ is great but our school choice costs $ a year how do i pay the rest

abbott since your child has great test scores the school will give them a scholarship to cover the rest of the cost 

family c awesome $ is great but our school choice costs $ a year how do i pay the rest

abbott since your child didnt have the best test scores its not our problem go to the now underfunded public school 

family d awesome but my child has autism and the private school doesnt have any programs to deal with that 

abbott not my problem go to the now underfunded public school 

family e so awesome what time will the bus be by to pick up my child

abbott it wont but its not my problem go to the now underfunded public school 

family f awesome but my child has an iep for his special needs and our school of choice doesnt have programs to help him 

abbott not my problem go to the now underfunded public school 

public school how is taking only high test scorers with no special needs who can provide their own transportation which usually equates to being middle or upper class going to shrink the gap between the highest and lowest achieving students 

abbott not my problem do more with less im just happy that my rich donors are now happy with their discount and i know my kid doesnt have to sit next to a poor kid or one with a learning disability in class winwin for everyone by the way your special education student test scores will be counted towards your school test score average 

public schools thats not really fair thats not comparing apples to apples since the private schools dont have to accept kids who bring down their test score average 

abbott not my problem we will continue to make it look like you are the biggest failure in the world","9"

a natural experiment occurs when an external event or policy change creates conditions that resemble a controlled experiment even though the researchers didnt set it up intentionally epidemiologists and social scientists often use natural experiments to analyze the effects of exposures like pollution diseases or public health policies when randomized controlled trials would be impractical or unethical

for example the chernobyl disaster provided a natural experiment for studying the effects of radiation exposure on human health another famous example is john snows  cholera study in london where differences in water supply sources unintentionally created conditions that allowed him to demonstrate that cholera was waterborne","41"

its a faith in a god that enters into the suffering alongside creation experiences it and defeats it by identifying within it 
  
god sustains us in all things but prevents no suffering is how i understand christ 

but like i fuck with meister eckart teresa of avila st john of the cross thomas merton and people like that 

i really fucking despise yeah i know its a weakness people who take the name of christ and use it to sign off on denying christ in other people

part of why so many mennonites are there or cults in general like the flds compound from ~+ years ago google warren jeffs for that one is the state only cares about truancy from school until you claim homeschooling and suddenly they dont give a fuck they dont even keep track of the kids so in cultabusive families its easier for the abuse to thrive cause theres basically no check in so its much easier to completely isolate their children theres suddenly no mandatory reporters add in keeping away from medical care for routine stuff and that drops encountering mandatory reporters to near impossible

its why things like the homeschool coalition are big in texas and religious homeschool curriculum that are actually pitiful and chockfull of falsehoods have expos across texas every year it allows parents to dominate their children and most wont be able to hack it in college from the piss poor educational foundation they were forced to have

id hope that the kids have a chance to break free but seminole is poor as fuck quite isolated and so the children wont have the chance to easily broaden their horizons unless they are an individual with natural burning curiosity that is willing to fight like hell to get out of that dusty pond and those individuals are people that end up targeted because they are different from the herd and out of that different group most would rather pop their head back down than risk getting whacked by the hammer of local authority

the measles vaccine was introduced in   this was a time when you could strongly argue that both diet and health which im taking to mean more physically active and fit were much better than today  processed and fast food were popular but both were not consumed at levels you see today  it was also a pre internetless tv screen time era where outdoor activity and play was more the norm for kids  

in  the us had  cases  by  when an improved version of the vaccine came out cases had dropped to   cases continued to trend downward all the way to  where cases hit  us cases   

from  to  you will probably find that less physical activity and processedfast food became more and more the norm even as case numbers continue to fall   

if food and health were the key then if anything  you would expect to see cases steadily rise each year as food and diet declined  

in fact cases have been on the rise lately mainly due to vaccine rates dropping

this article first opened my eyes its so damn obvious so can believe how ignorant i was when i was also with fauci  i believed most of what he said except he was clearly dishonest about his research and his involvement with wiv 



also this book which thoroughly and conclusively documented all the mountains and mountains of evidence that wuhan constitute of virology was making covid like viruses they had the means will opportunity and it blew up right in their area after some of their employees got sick that is the least convincing evidence in the book its filled with mind blowing facts about the biological capabilities to alter covid viruses without traces of genetic engineering they called it the no seeum technique they had cages filled with infected bats with various strains they took those strains and allowed them to spread an evolve in humanized mice by humanized i mean genetically engineered mice which make the human ace cmreceptor this is the same receptor covid binds to  read the book if you have courage to learn you are wrong



fauci and the proximal origins theory paper was a fraud just before that paper fauci emails show the authors all had a secret meeting not inviting cdc director robert redfield and the meeting conclusion was that they need to downplay the lab leak theory for the sake of science and global harmony



global harmony how harmonious even the next covid maybe a super covid that kills  is accidentally leaked as well","1_1_4_1_1"

i now agree with nicks central conclusion we still do not know the source of this awful pandemic we may never know but the argument that it could have leaked out of the wuhan institute of virology or a sister lab in wuhan has become considerably stronger than it was a year ago when the screaming was so loud that it drowned out serious discussion



so there we are all we have so far is speculation and all the explanations are unsatisfactory the whole thing may just be a cold case and stay that way forever but there are more embers left to sift the whole world china included needs a hard answer whoever is to blame  so we can prevent this from happening again



he doesnt share your certainty he presents a case for the wet market as well as a case for the lab leak he actually seems to be more in alignment with me and dr fauci than he does you



 they didnt find the source of the original sars virus until   years after the outbreak they may yet prove zoonotic origin for covid  they may prove a lab leak but neither one has been critically proven at this point","1_1_4_1_1_1"

 ironically these are often the same people who vote against food security child care safe affordable housing parental leave health care  all the jesus things people need to make the choice to have children these are often the same folks who support the death penalty even though their religion does not  

the people who use religion as an excuse appear to cherry pick the bible so it fits their specific desires 

so the hypocrisy is strong and makes one wonder if they just want to slough off the protection their children need  which requires a percentage of people to be vaccinated  on to someone elses kids 

many catholics used this as an excuse even though their spiritual leader  picked by god  says vaccination is a moral obligation 







no major religion prohibits vaccines but of course the danger of religion is that you get to create god in your own image even evangelical religions do not prohibit but people will say it does 



once again  unless people follow all the tenets of a religion 
i suspect they are just being selfish and foisting protection on others 

gtmany such objections are pretextual in australia antivaccinationists founded the church of conscious living a fake church leading to religious exemptions being removed in that country and one us pastor was reported to offer vaccine exemptions in exchange for online membership of his church



some religions insist you and your children must suffer and die rather than use medicine or blood transfusions jehovahs witnesses christian scientists some orthodox jewish sects 

vaccines and fetal cells lines  

gtno the covid vaccines do not contain aborted fetal cells however johnson amp johnson did use fetal cell lines  not fetal tissue  when developing and producing their vaccine while pfizer and moderna used fetal cell lines to test their vaccines and make sure that they work

gtfetal cell lines are grown in a laboratory and were started with cells from elective abortions that occurred several decades ago in the ss they are now thousands of generations removed from the original fetal tissue none of the covid vaccines use fetal cells derived from recent abortions","12_1"

 once we had vaccines that were highly effective and the number of cases was dropping older people would be protected by herd immunity as well as potential natural immunity

even the cdc says that experts arent sure why the mmr may fail in some adults

gtvery few peopleabout three out of who get two doses of measles vaccine will still get measles if exposed to the virus experts arent sure why it could be that their immune systems didnt respond as well as they should have to the vaccine but the good news is fully vaccinated people who get measles seem more likely to have a milder illness and fully vaccinated people seem also less likely to spread the disease to other people including people who cant get vaccinated because they are too young or have weakened immune systems

this is the only reason i never got the covid shot and never get flu shots  i cant handle injections without extreme measures  i also dont have insurance so it would be at a random very public place with long lines  my social anxiety cant even  but i stay out of public generally i go to work  thats it  of the time and my workspace is very isolated and i rarely have interactions with the public and happily mask up and keep my distance from others

i was so worried id need an mmr booster got my last one in  and i elbowed one nurse in the face and kicked another in my histrionics of sheer terror because i live in a very red very antivax place  im  and i dont know if measles is like chicken pox where its worse when youre older but was concerned i could catch it somehow  i did have chicken pox in  when i was in nd grade  first ones appeared on the palm of my hand which isnt the normal presentation at all  i dont remember being sick feeling but do remember the itching and not being able to scratch  totally worth the two weeks off school though haha

funnily enough i have many tattoos  for some reason i can sit through hrs of tattooing but will shriek in terror and cling to the ceiling if someone comes at me with a hypodermic  but i have no piercings due to the stabbing with a needle issue

i wish they could do vaccines without the need for injection  id eat or swallow something gross or have something gross smeared on a cutsmall open wound to my body the original vaccine as i also have dermatophagia and often have open wounds on my fingers or ill chew a new one no problem  i only got a tetanus shot because i was nearly killed in a car wreck and was in a coma for two weeks so they gave it to me then  i had to kick and scream at the top of my lungs to get the nurse to not to give me a heparin shot the first day i was awake as she did not respect my autonomy when i said i dont want that  again not scared of the medicine just the needle  plus i didnt want to pay for it  that same nurse just expected me to swallow pills without telling me what they were or why i needed them  i asked she said just take them  again not scared of medicine but did want to know what they were giving me after seeing how much fentanyl ketamine and morphine they kept me dosed up with when i thumbed through my medical records while awake in the hospital bed  am afraid of those  i dont like opiates they make me sick

it sounds cruel but at least the american gene pool will get a much needed dose of chlorine  children will die but at least it cuts off that legacy so absolute stupidity it isnt proliferated in the human race

how the wealthy cut the line during floridas frenzied vaccine rollout



in west palm beach mayor james says he was still trying to secure vaccines for his towns firefighters when he learned that at a nursing home in town some board members and their wealthy pals got vaccinated even though those doses were only supposed to be given to elderly residents and staff

then the private jets started arriving

hollywood moguls new york socialites and tourists from overseas were getting vaccinated in florida posting on social media and sparking outrage early on there were no residency requirements to get vaccinated in the state

keith james people were saying listen this is a resource and i know its out there and im gonna use whatever leverage i have to get that resource there were no rules

sharyn alfonsi it sounds like the hunger games

keith james thats a pretty good way of putting it and those who had the fiscal resources were gonna use them in whatever way they could to get this vaccine

 the elderly that are already retired arent reflected in these numbers

he complained that his medicare supplement had gone up by $ to $ a month and i knew that was high i went to medicaregov and printed out  choices  of which were cheaper than his with one $ cheaper 

i brought it over with a note recommending that he go to the local senior services agency to discuss this even though all he had to do was get on the phone and call the companies

he couldnt handle what i was bringing to him so then he started to vent he told me that during the  years that he lived in holland they had a system where everybody was required to buy private health insurance with some people getting subsidies from the government and that worked great over there and he said that trump was going to fix our system 

i didnt mention to him that we have already tried that in this country and that as an example  of medicare recipients are covered by private insurance medicare advantage plans and that advantage plans actually cost the government more than traditional medicare medicare has the lowest admin costs of any health insurance

there are those in power who hoped let er rip would elminate a lot of people form social security and medicare rolls but more people still working were lost and no longer contributing

add in the impairment if not outright disabiling of  of people with every infection it is taking a toll on people being able to do the jobs the used to do

and while there have yet to be studies on the effects on lowering cognitive abilities affecting emotional self control i suspect the worstening state of peoples behavior is not just political with certain people and groups giving them permission to be their worst selves its is some sort of brain damage to the bits handling self control so they let out all the racism sexism anti certain religions or sects just all around nastiness general bad behavior more like brain of a child before learning to control impulses of course made worse by politicans and social media influencing those behaviors is a horrible combination","1_1_2"
