The medical and Pharma industries have massive systemic issues that need to be addressed, but the actual people doing the work are really just looking to do the best they can for society.

I was at a 4th of July party last year where most people didnt know me.  It was really disheartening to hear a bunch of the other guests go in on how all vaccines are actually poison and that the people making them are in an evil conspiracy to kill us all.  I was literally working  on a new Flu vaccine at the time and it really hurt to hear how many people think me and my colleagues are just purely evil people, hell bent on killing kids for fun.  

My specific role is to ensure that patient safety and that their rights are being fully protected and respected.  I have literally lost a job before because I was unwilling to violate a patients rights and decided to put myself in the way to ensure she was protected.  Its really hard to have someone tell you that they think you deliberately kill other people for a measly pay check, when they literally have zero idea how the system works or what my job actually is.","3_1_1_1_2"

Appeals to emotional demands work. Not all of them can feel these, but you have to get specific family members or community thoughts involved. A fact won't do a damned thing, but, ""how would the members of your church feel if they knew you could have lived, if you had just chosen to take a single vaccine? Imagine how sad, and disappointed they would be, that rather than bringing light into their lives, you brought darkness. How could you do that to them? How? Could you even forgive someone that did that--if you knew you could have had 5 more years with your *known dead loved one* if they had simply done *something similar*, and didn't, how would you feel?"" 

And get them to explain it using feelings. 

Because they're going to dismiss facts with feelings, and they have no facts to dismiss an appeal to emotion, and, their emotions ARE their logic process, so you have to guide the ones that make strong and intense reactions come up, to get them to make the snap decisions to do the thing.

Besides the measles vaccine, the worst to skip is Tetanus. One of my paternal great grandmothers died from tetanus in 1926. I have a copy of the death certificate. Tetanus is NOT contagious. It is caused by a bacteria that exists virtually everywhere all the time. The bacteria produces a toxin that causes the symptoms. It is one of the most gruesome ways to die with muscle contractions so strong they can break bones.

The GOP has been pumping out the same anti-science playbook for decades now. Any research that deviates even slightly from the party line (read: bottom line) is challenged/discredited the same way: ""they're shills, determining their results by what gets them paid"". 

If there's one thing that's been proven time and time again with the GOP, it's that every accusation is a confession ( hell, it's the P in the ol' Gaslight, Obstruct, Project). I'd bet my house that the ""study selection"" process will take ages, be fraught with turnover, and ultimately yield very questionable appointees to run the study (if he doesn't start with outright cronies from the jump and skip the appearance of legitimacy angle outright). Beyond that, I am certain that the results that are presented will, at a minimum, claim some vague correlation between vaccines and autism and muddy the waters all over again.

It will get shredded by every reputable peer in the review process, and be universally panned and rejected by anyone of any expertise, but it will be too late.

Just like with the Mueller report, the ""first take/conclusion/summary"" will hit the airwaves first, with the health tzar himself taking the right-wing media tour to claim ""victory"", then the study will be published for review, then it'll be shown to be an outright fraud and the right wing sphere will never hear a word of it.

Only this time it'll have the CDC's letterhead throwing weight behind it, helping to get more children killed from preventable diseases.

Edit: Ive gone back and forth about including this but I decided to, and Im going to do my best to be respectful. I think their being Mennonites and her being a girl has a lot to do with his reaction. I have two different experiences with these groups that make me feel somewhat qualified to say this: I grew up fundamentalist christian, and while we werent Mennonite we had a lot of Mennonite friends; and now Im an ER nurse in an area with a large Amish population (you could think of Mennonite as the overlap in the Venn diagram between fundamentalist christians and Amish). Now, I want to be clear, I am NOT accusing Amish or Mennonite people of not loving their daughters. They absolutely do, they are parents like anybody else. But there is a very obvious gender preference when it comes to children, and they are extremely stoic and have a very strong sense of resigning themselves to gods will. Its not that they arent allowed to mourn their children when they die, but child mortality is an accepted part of life for them in a way that it hasnt been for the English (non-Amish) since the 19th century. For instance, theres a situation that very strongly stands out for me of an Amish baby girl I had who started crumping pretty badly, and a coworker made the comment that just judging off facial expression and intensity she would have thought that the doctor and I were her parents and the parents were the HCWs. And if youve ever seen a good ED team at work, youll know that were very good at pushing our emotions down until the situation is over and were in a place where we can process without an active emergency happening, so you can imagine how much even more stoic the parents were. Again, Im not saying Amish/Mennonite people dont love their kids, and in fact the most uninterested, distant parents Ive seen have been English. But it plays a role.","1_6"

They are Mennonite, so, very isolated from most of the world. 

They don't have prom lol they live and think very differently. 

They are raised to be skeptical of everything that isn't Mennonite and many don't speak English despite being born and raised in their home countries. 

So everything they hear is being filtered through, nearby conservative communities, fear of modernization, and conservative elders.

They also process death a bit differently because of their faith. To them, their daughter dying is heartbreaking, but also god's will.

They also deal with measles all the time and most kids don't die so this was shocking for them. They did take her to the ER and try to get her help, it was just too late.","28_1"

I could be wrong, but I'm assuming you did the photo search to see whether or not this photo or the company or group using it was actually ""real"" or legitimate, which the result in turn could be used for your judgement or opinion about the company or group. If that was the case though, then it may be a much much better idea to actually just simply do a google search for the *company's name*, ""physicians for informed consent"". I'm sure they will be the first link in the results if they are legit. I see no other purpose for doing a reverse image search on this, especially to post a comment about it so I'm probably correct about my assumption.

So, to your argument, yes, stock images are pretty normal. That isn't the point we are trying to make. We all know people in our lives who see things like this on Facebook and take it at face value and believe it to be true just because they see a picture of a guy who ""looks"" like a doctor. It shows how easily they are fooled and how eager they are to share something that backs their fringe ideologies while saying that people who support science and vaccines are easily swayed to believe that vaccines are indeed safe. It's the same as when your grandma believes AI images are real. it shows a lack if media literacy. 



And second, no, we aren't saying they aren't a non-legitimate group because they aren't showing their true faces in their propaganda. It's just very telling how easily their base of followers can be fooled and swindled to believe it. And also, how cowardly they are for not showing their faces in their propaganda. 

  
Your argument to google the group and do further research instead of doing an image search of the guy in the pictures... well, why doesn't the group put their images forward to their loyal followers? 

I mean, your arguments are deflecting the sole purposes of our points.","2_2_1_1"

But being an ""autism parent"", perhaps you've seen information relating to it.  

2 things, really. #1: are there no genetic/bio markers that would predict with high reliability that autism will develop in an individual? I'm thinking of something done at birth or 1 month.  #2: given the increase in the antivax movement, don't we now have a statistically large enough population of unvaxxed kids such that we could do a study of them, specifically the % of them who fall on the spectrum (which would, of course, be about the same as the % of vaxxed kids who fall on the spectrum).  

Perhaps it's overly optimistic of me, but I'd like to think that either (or both!) of those situations would get at least some of the AV crowd to shut the hell up.

It's been awhile so I could be misremembering, but I believe the answer is no because Autism can't be clinically diagnosed.

So homeopathics is based on this concept that ""like can cure like"".  If you have a fever, take something that would cause a fever to like... ""over do it"" to cure it?   I dunno.   

I can _kinda_ see the logic because there are a handful of examples where things actually work that way.  Best example is Capsaicin, the chemical (one of them?) that causes many spicy peppers and such to be so spicy.

Doctors have found that this same chemical can be used for pain **relief** in cases where the patient has neuropathic pain (like shingles) that can't be relieved with tylenol.  You're essentially loading down the pain receptors until they can't bind to anything any more. (I'm not a doctor, I'm sure someone with that education and experience can be more specific here.  But my understanding is that is the broad strokes.)

The other half of homeopathic is this bullshit notion that matter has ""memory"" of some kind.  So if you take a water molecule and put it next to a lead molecule, then get rid of the lead, then the water will retain some properties of the lead.

Again... I can _kinda_ see the logic if you don't have any kind of real science background.  If you mix something into water... it feels like the water is ""contaminated"" and you can't ever really get it all out.  It's the reason many people are grossed out by the idea of drinking their own (filtered, and cleaned) urine.

But in this case, they are taking 50/50 belladona and water... cutting it with more water and pouring off the extra.  Then adding more water and pouring off the extra.  Again and again and again until all that is left is just water with ""basically"" no belladona remaining.  Below whatever safe threshold (hopefully... if they did it right...) is safe to consume.

So yeah.  It's all bullshit.  And so long as you trust the source... and **also** _seek proper medical treatment_... it's mostly harmless.

But when people treat with water and avoid taking their 104 fever to the hospital...  believe it or not, straight to jail.  Those people are monsters.","1_6"

&gt;The virus can wipe out the immune system, a complication called immune amnesia.

&gt;When we get sick with viruses or bacteria, our immune systems have the ability to form memories that quickly allow them to recognize and respond to the pathogens if theyre encountered again. 

&gt;Measles targets cells in the body, such as plasma cells and memory cells, that contain those immunologic memories, destroying some of them in the process.

&gt;Nobody escapes this, said Dr. Michael Mina, a vaccine expert and former professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who has led some of the research in the field. 

&gt;In a 2019 study, Mina and his team found that a measles infection can wreck anywhere from 11% to 73% of a persons antibody stockpile, depending on how severe the infection.  That means that if people had 100 antibodies to chickenpox before they had measles, they may be left with just 50 after measles infections, potentially making them more vulnerable to catching it and getting sicker.  

&gt;Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunology at the Yale School of Medicine, said: Thats why its called amnesia. We forget who the enemies are. 

&gt;While virtually everybody who gets infected with measles will have their immune systems weakened, some will be hit harder than others.

&gt;**Theres no world in which you get measles and it doesnt destroy some [immunity], he said. The question is does it destroy enough to really make a clinical impact.**

&gt;**In an earlier study from 2015, Mina estimated that before vaccinations, when measles was common, the virus could have been implicated in as many as half of all childhood deaths from infectious disease, mostly from other diseases such as pneumonia, sepsis, diarrheal diseases and meningitis.**

&gt;The researchers found that after a measles infection, the immune system can be suppressed almost immediately and remain that way for two to three years.

&gt;Immune amnesia really begins as soon as the virus replicates in those [memory] cells, Mina said. 

&gt;The best defense against serious complications is the measles vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective in preventing infection.","3_1"

The vaccines do exactly the same thing, except you dont have to survive the illness. This is whats so wild to me. Theyre so hung up on natural immunity like its somehow better than fake (but equally or often MORE effective) immunity from a vaccine.","3_1_1"

Then you only have a mild day or two of symptoms after the vaccine without The many times higher is illness hospitalization disability and or death from the actual illnesses. 

It's not like immunity to flow from an infection last any longer than seasonal flu vaccine immunity. People can get flu twice in a season with natural immunity even with the same strength. 

With covid back when they sequence things heavily in several countries they found people could get the same strain again in a couple weeks!

In my opinion vaccines are superior because it's like having a micro infection with a minute rare risk of severe side effects vs so-called natural immunity 

I suggest the people who are so in favor of a natural immunity find one of those companies that want to study people having the actual infection and go to work for them and get sick over and over and see what that does to them with all the gory scientific details revealed to them at the end.

 There have been several studies that show not only coated but flu increases your risk of heart attack for a time after having it and that people who get the vaccines are less likely to have heart attacks or other clot problems because they did not get sick or at least they did not get severely sick. 

There are several studies that are finding certain vaccines are associated with lower rates of dementia. The shingles vaccine is about to or or might already have started their study to see if it prevents it there's enough evidence that the company is going for the study itself so they can put that as a reason for people to get it not just prevent shingles 

There's other studies that look at people who get infections and found that certain infections are associated with higher rates of dementia which points the possibility that vaccinations against those illnesses will reduce risk of dementia as well as simply getting the illnesses and any other known complication thereof.","3_1_1_1"

It still exists, but it's in a lab only). I was able to find a subheadliner to a news article saying that two strains were isolated, but when I opened it, I couldn't find anything further on the strains.

During times of stress (emotional or physical) it can reactivate and travel along the nerve bodies and cause an excruciating eruption of blisters on the skin at the nerve ending. It doesn't happen to everyone who was infected with chicken pox, but it's fairly common. You can't get the booster until you're at least 50 without significant medical reasoning, and they recommend you wait until 60 because the protection is only good for 10-15 years and they don't recommend boosters at this time. 

I've had it three times. And while usually the virus only goes dormant on one set of nerve cells, so you only get shingles that appears in one spot on the body (commonly the side of the chest), I get them on both my right sciatic nerve and around my right eye. So two outbreaks on my right hip, one of which caused post-herpetic neuralgia for a year in my mid-20s, and another around my eye in my early 30s that thankfully only lasted a couple weeks because I got Valtrex right away. 

While Canada and the US have vaccinated for Varicella for many years, the NHS in the UK currently does not as they were concerned that shingles rates would go up - it was believed that repeated exposure to chicken pox virus stopped people from developing shingles. However, there's been no increase in rates of shingles in countries that use the Varicella vaccine, even in people who do not get the Shingles vaccine, and the recommendation is now pending there.","8_1"

Eventually my whole body broke down after I had my kids and I ended up on disability with permanent damage, because it turned out I actually had celiac disease, Crohn's, and Psoriatic arthritis the whole time. I've had the start of two other outbreaks since, but recognized the burning pain and got Valtrex right away, so it never developed beyond that! Vaccinate your kids folks! (To be clear, I'm in my 40s, the vaccine did not exist when I was a kid and got chicken pox!!! My parents fully vaccinated me against everything available in Canada!).","8_1_1_1"

&gt;Introduction of ribonucleic acids into cells by means of liposomes

&gt;National Institute for Medical Research,The Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, UK

&gt;ABSTRACT

&gt;A method of ultramicroinjection of nucleic acids into cultured cells by means of liposomes is described.

&gt;Messenger RNA, ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA were entrapped in large unilamellar liposomes and subsequently the liposomes were fused with cells.

&gt;The uptake of RNA by the cells was stimulated 6 - 8 times by our method. Possible application's of microinjection of RNA by means of liposomes are discussed.","3"

Most outbreaks begin when an unvaccinated person of relatively high socioeconomic status travels to measles-endemic countries. If I remember correctly, nearly half of the 2019 cases originated from one person in New York who traveled to Israel where an outbreak was occurring at the time. 

If I was a betting woman, Id venture to guess most of the migrants crossing the southern border are not taking international vacations that require a plane ride. The entire Americas region eliminated endemic measles in the 2010s. Outbreaks occur nearly exclusively to due to incoming or outgoing international travel.","1_1_2"

Family lore goes,  when I was born I needed a blood transfusion.

With your mom's timeline it looks like the CDC confirmed blood born transmission in 1982/3? Didn't test donated blood as a standard till later, but the transmission via blood would have been known at that point at least. Don't know if that explains any of it.

I was born before we had regular vaccinations for childhood diseases and we never had 'herd immunity' for them just regular waves of them every year

Malaria was mostly eradicated in the US in the [early 20th Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria#Eradication_efforts)

Scarlet Fever doesn't have a vaccine anyway but can be controlled with hygiene &amp; isolation

Yellow Fever has a safe &amp; effective vaccine which when combined with mosquito control means it's really only a danger outside of western countries

Tuberculosis was reduced significantly with the vaccine, better hygiene helps,

There was never a herd immunity for these diseases before the vaccine came along, nutrition, clean water and sanitation helps but we had those before we had the vaccines, in the west anyway, and the [diseases were still rampant](https://www.science.org/content/article/here-s-visual-proof-why-vaccines-do-more-good-harm)","3"

The medical and Pharma industries have massive systemic issues that need to be addressed, but the actual people doing the work are really just looking to do the best they can for society.

I was at a 4th of July party last year where most people didnt know me.  It was really disheartening to hear a bunch of the other guests go in on how all vaccines are actually poison and that the people making them are in an evil conspiracy to kill us all.  I was literally working  on a new Flu vaccine at the time and it really hurt to hear how many people think me and my colleagues are just purely evil people, hell bent on killing kids for fun.  

My specific role is to ensure that patient safety and that their rights are being fully protected and respected.  I have literally lost a job before because I was unwilling to violate a patients rights and decided to put myself in the way to ensure she was protected.

They're right (mostly) I just kinda felt like expanding on it.

So homeopathics is based on this concept that ""like can cure like"".  If you have a fever, take something that would cause a fever to like... ""over do it"" to cure it?   I dunno.   

I can _kinda_ see the logic because there are a handful of examples where things actually work that way.  Best example is Capsaicin, the chemical (one of them?) that causes many spicy peppers and such to be so spicy.

Doctors have found that this same chemical can be used for pain **relief** in cases where the patient has neuropathic pain (like shingles) that can't be relieved with tylenol.  You're essentially loading down the pain receptors until they can't bind to anything any more. (I'm not a doctor, I'm sure someone with that education and experience can be more specific here.  But my understanding is that is the broad strokes.)

The other half of homeopathic is this bullshit notion that matter has ""memory"" of some kind.  So if you take a water molecule and put it next to a lead molecule, then get rid of the lead, then the water will retain some properties of the lead.

Again... I can _kinda_ see the logic if you don't have any kind of real science background.  If you mix something into water... it feels like the water is ""contaminated"" and you can't ever really get it all out.  It's the reason many people are grossed out by the idea of drinking their own (filtered, and cleaned) urine.

But in this case, they are taking 50/50 belladona and water... cutting it with more water and pouring off the extra.  Then adding more water and pouring off the extra.  Again and again and again until all that is left is just water with ""basically"" no belladona remaining.  Below whatever safe threshold (hopefully... if they did it right...) is safe to consume.

So yeah.  It's all bullshit.  And so long as you trust the source... and **also** _seek proper medical treatment_... it's mostly harmless.

But when people treat with water and avoid taking their 104 fever to the hospital...  believe it or not, straight to jail.  Those people are monsters.","1_6"

During times of stress (emotional or physical) it can reactivate and travel along the nerve bodies and cause an excruciating eruption of blisters on the skin at the nerve ending. It doesn't happen to everyone who was infected with chicken pox, but it's fairly common. You can't get the booster until you're at least 50 without significant medical reasoning, and they recommend you wait until 60 because the protection is only good for 10-15 years and they don't recommend boosters at this time. 

I've had it three times. And while usually the virus only goes dormant on one set of nerve cells, so you only get shingles that appears in one spot on the body (commonly the side of the chest), I get them on both my right sciatic nerve and around my right eye. So two outbreaks on my right hip, one of which caused post-herpetic neuralgia for a year in my mid-20s, and another around my eye in my early 30s that thankfully only lasted a couple weeks because I got Valtrex right away. 

While Canada and the US have vaccinated for Varicella for many years, the NHS in the UK currently does not as they were concerned that shingles rates would go up - it was believed that repeated exposure to chicken pox virus stopped people from developing shingles. However, there's been no increase in rates of shingles in countries that use the Varicella vaccine, even in people who do not get the Shingles vaccine, and the recommendation is now pending there.","8_1"

Most outbreaks begin when an unvaccinated person of relatively high socioeconomic status travels to measles-endemic countries. If I remember correctly, nearly half of the 2019 cases originated from one person in New York who traveled to Israel where an outbreak was occurring at the time. 

If I was a betting woman, Id venture to guess most of the migrants crossing the southern border are not taking international vacations that require a plane ride. The entire Americas region eliminated endemic measles in the 2010s. Outbreaks occur nearly exclusively to due to incoming or outgoing international travel.","1_1_2"

Then she started saying the Disneyland outbreak was caused by kids who had gotten the measles shots recently. I just no-saled her and told her that's not what happened. I know because I had a newborn at the time of those outbreaks and was almost exposed to it in a hospital. The outbreaks were caused by parents refusing to get their precious snowflakes the MMR vaccine, just like they are now.

The PT was pretty upset that I didn't accept her alternative reality and it got super weird after that. Plus I lost respect for her as a medical professional. So I stopped seeing her.","2"
